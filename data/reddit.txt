I want you to kick me in the butt ,” insisted the Israeli.So the terrorist leader shoved him into the open and kicked him in the behind. The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9 mm pistol from under his flak jacket, and shot the leader dead. In the resulting confusion, he jumped to his knapsack, pulled out his carbine and sprayed the terrorists with gunfire. In a flash, all terrorists were either dead or fleeing for their lives. As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him, “Why didn’t you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?”“What?” replied the Israeli, “and have you report that I was the aggressor?"

She didn't share his love of tractors quite as much and began to get upset as Alan would spend more time at tractor conventions than with her. Weekends away, and even when he was home all he talked about were tractors. One day She said ""Right! I've had enough Alan, I love you to bits, you're my whole world. But I can't go on with you spending more time with friggin tractors than with your wife"". She gave him a choice, ""It's me or the tractors Alan, what will it be?"".

1	"Five friends were sitting around, debating which Pixar movie is the greatest_____After a few hours of debate, no one was willing to concede, and it was decided that a vote must be held. Unfortunately, with so few friends present, it was clear that they would need to bring the vote to the greater public. The group decided that each friend would make a plea to the subreddit of their choice, and whoever received the most karma for it would win.Adam, already undecided himself, decided to go to /r/AskReddit. He laid out the agreement, and asked that everyone vote one their favorite movie, and the one with the most votes he would use for the his friends. Unfortunately, as the votes were split in that sub, his highest post amounted to a mere 38 points.Paul, a big proponent for the Toy Story franchise, posted to /r/nostalgia in the hopes that everyone who grew up with Toy Story would agree. Unfortunately, as there had been two sequels (with a third on the way) it wasn't exactly considered ""nostalgia"" and he got downvoted into oblivion.Bill, who loved Monsters Inc., made his case using some trickery. Going to /r/news, he found a seemingly unrelated post, and made a top-level comment describing, in great detail, why Monsters Inc. was the greatest film of all time. The fact that the post was so out of context made everyone flock to it, and drew enough attention to new him over a thousand fake internet points.Mike, who loved the Incredibles movies, decided to stay in his wheelhouse. Over the course of several hours, he created each of the family members from the Incredibles in Soulcaliber VI. Finally, he photoshopped the family together, and posted it to /r/gaming. Under normal circumstances this would have skyrocketed to the top, but the format was stale, and thus only received 20k karma. Still, Mike was confident in his victory.While the other four friends came up with plans on how to maximize their karma gains, Chris sat silently. For hours he sat, making no posts, coming up with no original content. Finally, an hour before the deadline, he broke into his neighbor's house, stealing his copy of the Pixar movie ""Up"". He took a picture of his theft and posted it directly to /r/Jokes with the title ""STOLEN"".When the group got together the next day to see who got the most votes, everyone was in awe. Chris's post had over 40,000 points. ""How did you know that would win?"" ""Easy,"" Chris replied. ""Everyone knows stolen content on /r/Jokes gets all the Up votes."""

It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole and disappeared!""""Nah"", says the farmer, ""That couldn't have been my goat. My goat was chained to a railroad tie."""

So he moves on.He goes over to where the vodka is, deciding that it would be nice with something mixed into it.

0	Engineers!_____Background information:In India we have long distance trains which are pulled using engines and have toilet facilities, and seats which double as beds. It issues two types of tickets one is to ride the train (used by people to travel short distances, 8-10hrs) and another is to ride the train and have a seat assigned (used for longer distances).We also have, in certain cities like Mumbai, a local train system, which is electric, has only seats (which people do sometimes use as beds) and no toilet facilities, usually running within the city or to closer by towns a short distance away, usually the entire journey is under 5hrsOnto the joke.5 doctors and 5 engineers had to go out of the city, so they had a short 5-6 hour travel in the long distance train. The doctors had purchased a ticket each and the engineers bought 1 ticket and split the cost. The ticket collector (TC) came around to check the tickets. He clipped the tickets of each of the doctors and in the meantime all the engineers went and hid in the toilet. The TC knocked on the door, it was opened ever so slightly and the single ticket was thrust out, the TC checked it, clipped it and gave it back. On the return journey, the doctors were angry to have spent money. They decided to use the same trick as the engineers. They bought 1 ticket amongst themselves, the engineers noted this and didn't buy any tickets at all. When the TC arrived the doctors and engineers all went to hide in the toilet. The doctors were smiling thinking the engineers would be fined, when there is a knock on their door asking for a ticket. One of the doctors hands out the ticket and the engineer who asked for it takes it and goes back to the toilet they have hidden in. The real TC comes the engineers repeat the process and their ticket is clipped, while the doctors are asked to step out and are all fined. The doctors are livid.They reach the city and there is a further train they need to take to reach their work place. The doctors decide they won't but any ticket and will trick the engineers. The engineers all purchase a ticket apiece. The TC comes and the doctors smugly get up to hide in the toilet and the engineers quietly sit and have their tickets clipped. The doctors are all caught and fined again because there is no toilet in the local train.

One day, they found a stray dog; they wanted to keep the stray but they were worried about how their parents would react so they did it in secret.

One day, when they were walking this, he got run over by a car and died. Only 90’s kids will remember this.

He picked up the lance from the stricken knight, and fought off the second, who also fell sprawling on the floor. The second knight's horse shied, and bolted, colliding with the third knight in the process.The game show host was just beginning to enjoy himself now.

Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to ""Irritated"" or even ""A Bit Cross."" The English have not been ""A Bit Cross"" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from ""Tiresome"" to ""A Bloody Nuisance."" The last time the English issued a ""Bloody Nuisance"" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish Armada.The Scots have raised their threat level from ""Pissed Off"" to ""Let's Get the Bastards."" They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from ""Run"" to ""Hide."" The only two higher levels in France are ""Collaborate"" and ""Surrender."" The rise was precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.Italy has increased the alert level from ""Shout Loudly and Excitedly"" to ""Elaborate Military Posturing."" Two more levels remain: ""Ineffective Combat Operations"" and ""Change Sides.""The Germans have increased their alert state from ""Disdainful Arrogance"" to ""Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs."" They also have two higher levels: ""Invade a Neighbour"" and ""Lose.""Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from ""No worries"" to ""She'll be alright, Mate."" Two more escalation levels remain: ""Crikey! I think we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!"" and ""The barbie is cancelled."" So far, no situation has ever warranted use of this final escalation level.(Credits to the great non-sir John Cleese)."

1	What starts with “f” and ends with “k”?_____A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her more precocious students.  The teacher asked, “Harry, what exactly is your problem?”Harry answered, “I'm too smart for the 1st grade.  My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she!  I think I should be in the 3rd grade, too!”Ms. Brooks finally had enough; she took Harry to the principal's office.  While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the situation to the principal.  The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test.  If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave.  She agreed.Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he happily agreed to take the test.Principal:  “What is 3 x 3?”Harry:  “9.”Principal:  “What is 6 x 6?”Harry:  “36.”And so it went with every question the principal thought a bright 3rd grader should know.The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, “Y’know, I reckon Harry can go to the 3rd grade.”But Ms. Brooks is still skeptical of the little bugger and says to the principal, “Not so fast, let me ask him a few questions.”The principal and Harry both agree. Ms. Brooks asks, “What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?”Harry, after a moment:  “Legs.”Ms. Brooks:  “What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?”The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!Harry replied:  “Pockets.” to the Principal’s great relief. Ms. Brooks:  “What does a dog do that a man steps into?”Harry:  “Pants.”By now, the principal is sitting forward with his mouth hanging open.Ms. Brooks:  “What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?”Now the principal's eyes open really wide and before he could intervene, Harry replied, “Bubble gum.”Ms. Brooks:  “What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?”Harry:  “Shake hands.”The principal is now trembling with apprehension as Ms. Brooks asks the last question.Ms. Brooks:  “What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' and indicates a great deal of heat and excitement?”Harry: “Firetruck.”The principal breaths a huge sigh of relief and tells the teacher, “Put the little bastard in 5th Grade; I got the last seven questions wrong myself.”

At the sight, Adam did stare, There was Eve's treasure, All covered with hair. And wonder came, Under Eve's eyes, As Adam's thing, Started to rise. They found a spot, That suited them best, A nice big tree, Where they began to rest. Her legs spread wider, And wider apart, While thrill after thrill, Came into her heart. The head of Adam's thing, Peeked into the hole, And filled her with passion, Beyond her control. Backward and forward, His thing did slide, And Eve's treasure, Was all wet inside. The joy was good, She wouldn't let loose, Until Adam's thing, Was all out of juice. Then down through the years, People did screw, And now it is time, For me and you. So pull down your pants, And lay in the grass, Cause I'm in the mood, For a piece of that ASS!

0	"An attractive woman is sitting alone at the bar and sees a man with a military-style haircut sitting by himself at the other end, nursing his drink._____The woman notices that the man is looking glum and hasn't made any attempt to speak to anyone besides the barkeep. She takes a swig of liquid courage, saunters down the bar, and sits next to the man. ""Excuse me, sir, but are you a soldier? I couldn't help but notice your haircut!"" The woman says innocently. ""Yes ma'am, I am. I just got back from my second tour of duty"", he replies. ""Oh my! That's very brave of you. I don't mean to be too forthcoming, but you seem kind of down in the dumps. Is everything alright?"" The woman purrs. The man finishes his drink in a single quaff, takes a long, slow breath and relates to the woman that his longtime girlfriend left him on his first deployment, so he re-upped and went back in for a second tour. The second tour was grueling and gruesome and the man had lost several close friends in combat. He then explains that this was once his favorite bar but now it only brings back bad memories.""Goodness!"" The woman cried. ""You must be awfully lonely these days!"" The man nods and quietly says ""Yes ma'am. All I seem to know is how to be a soldier.""The woman, smitten by the handsome soldier, continues to sit beside him and they keep shooting the breeze. Between the booze, good conversation, and the obvious attraction, the pair realize the sexual tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. ""Forgive me for being brash, but when was the last time you had sex?"" The woman coos. The soldier thinks for a moment. ""I'd say probably 2015."" The woman is shocked and immediately whispers in his ear that she is going to change that. They catch a ride from the bar to her house, sucking face the whole way there. The two burst inside her home and immediately get hot and heavy. They make love everywhere and in all kinds of positions. After some of the most vigorous and fulfilling sex of their lives, the woman gasps, ""That was incredible! I can't believe you haven't had sex since 2015!"" The man turns to her with a puzzled look and says ""It was that noticeable? It's only 0100 now!"""

0	"If it hadn't been for this man I met on Reddit, I would have been married a long time ago..._____Backstory: Me and my BF of 5 years had what I thought was a great relationship and we were looking to settle down one day. But my life changed when I started chatting with this man on Reddit. I met him on r/jokes.This man complimented one of my jokes and we had a conversation which quickly turned into talking about each of our interests. We had a lot in common and I found out he lives in the same state I'm in..I was always curious about meeting another redditor in real life and I thought it would be a good chance to make a new friend, so I decided ""why not?"" and decided to meet with him.We went out to a nearby burger king, and honestly, I didn't know meeting someone for lunch at a burger king could be so exciting. He introduced himself as ""Joe"" and I was blushing as he introduced himself. It was sooo embarrassing, but I decided to continue on and play it cool.Having lunch with Joe was relaxing. There was one moment where I got scared because he poked his eye trying to take a sip from his straw. I could tell he poked his eye real badly. Thankfully, he made a joke about it and we laughed it off. I was worried about his eye but he told me not to worry about it since he could just visit a doctor the next day. It made me feel relieved. Turns out, Joe was so funny and such a genuinely kind and interesting person. To top it off, he was very handsome. After we had our lunch, we said our goodbyes and honestly I've never felt such a strong connection before.I hate to say it, but I was attracted to him, VERY. And of course, I felt very guilty afterwards. So I told my BF what happened. He understood why I did it and told me not to talk to that man anymore, but from there, everything went into a downward spiral. It happened over the course of a few weeks..We started arguing more, I kept on thinking about my lunch date with Joe, thinking about the ""what ifs"", and thinking that I needed to decide what I want with my life and what kind of person I wanted to spend it with.Me and my BF ended our relationship. It was sad, but we tried to end it on good terms as much as possible.After the breakup, I decided to contact the man I met on Reddit again, but he wouldn't answer me. I waited 2 weeks, still no answer. I couldn't find any of his profiles on Facebook, Instagram, or any social media. I wondered... ""did he give me a fake name?"" Was his name even Joe? I was pissed, but still eager to connect with him again.A couple of weeks later, I had an idea: ""how about I use Reddit.. to find this man...that I MET on Reddit?""Why didn't I think of this before?I created multiple posts on different subreddits asking to see if this man named Joe is still lurking on Reddit, and I asked Joe to reach out to me if he saw my post.Then one day.. I finally got it. An orange notification. It was a reply from Joe's original account when we first met! Who knew of all places, Reddit would be where I reconnected with the love of my life again.I quickly opened up my post that was just a few days old, with the title ""Reddit you come from, Reddit you go? Reddit you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?""&#x200B;"

0	An encounter at the tattoo parlor (OC)_____So, my girlfriend recently told me a story about how she went to the tattoo shop because she really wanted a new tattoo. It was supposed to be a full sleeve tattoo of a lion. The tattoo artist agreed, and after the job was done, he said the price was 500 dollars, turns out the girlfriend only had 400 with her. The tattoo artist said, “Well, you’re quite attractive, and I could knock the price down a bit if you show me your breasts.” So the girlfriend ends up doing it and gets the tattoo done at a low-low price of 400 dollarsI guess, you could say the exchange was really tit for tat.

What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.

1	"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam._____His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

1	A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up_____So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."""

I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We’ve tried everything.”Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.”  The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”Edit:  My Dad would have been unbelievably happy at how many people got a chuckle out of this.

He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...... and what a dive...!Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do.""

1	"A gorilla walks into a bar_____A gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. This totally amazes the bartender, but he thinks, ""What the heck, I guess I might as well make the drink."" So he mixes the martini. He then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it. So, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, ""Let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything."" So he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. ""You know,"" he says to the gorilla, ""we don't get too many gorillas in here."" And the gorilla says, ""At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised."""

1	Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community..._____If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

1	"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it._____There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.    About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.    The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.    The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".    ""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.    ""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""    The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""    The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""    The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""    The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""    The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""    ""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.    Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""    The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.    It's unbelievable.    The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.    The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""    The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death."""
1	Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts_____Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !!

As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something."" The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat satback on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150."""

None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""Curious, Attila did as he asked.Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun."""

1	"Jack, a renown atheist, dies..._____... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by Satan himself.Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""EDIT: sorry to those who didn't like it, love ya all r/jokes and thanks for the gold.EDIT2: Sort by controversial."

1	"Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there._____He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline."""

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.Edit: Thanks for the silver, kind stranger!

She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket..._____As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus. Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt.

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends."""

He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. ""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE!

Before she says a word, Bob says, “I’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” After thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob.After a few seconds, Bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…“Who was that?” “It was Bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “Great!” the husband says, “Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”*Moral of the story:*If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.&nbsp;**Lesson 2:**A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, “I’ll give each of you just one wish” “Me first! Me first!” says the administration clerk. “I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” Poof! She’s gone. “Me next! Me next!” says the sales rep. “I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life.” Poof! He’s gone. “OK, you’re up,” the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, “I want those two back in the office after lunch.”*Moral of the story:*Always let your boss have the first say&nbsp;**Lesson 3:**A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,”Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, “Father, remember Psalm 129?” The priest apologized “Sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, “Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”*Moral of the story:*If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity&nbsp;**Lesson 4**A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, ”Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” The crow answered: “Sure, why not.” So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.*Moral of the story:*To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up&nbsp;**Lesson 5:**Power of CharismaA turkey was chatting with a bull “I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but I haven’t got the energy.” “Well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “They’re packed with nutrients.” The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.*Moral of the story:*Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there&nbsp;**Lesson 6**A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.*Moral of the story:*1.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

One little boy stands up and offers, “if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.”“Not quite”, says Mr. Trump, “that would be an accident.”A little girl raises her hand: “if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”“I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call a great loss.”The room goes silent. Trump searches the room. “Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says, “If Air Force One, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.”“Fantastic!” exclaimed Mr. Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”“Well’, said little Johnny, “because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”

The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'.  The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money . The elderly woman replied that she made bets.  The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?'  The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.'  The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.   The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?'  'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.'  'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.'   'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently.  That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that way, up and down, turned it around, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.  The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square  The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.  The president was happy to oblige.  The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.'  The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the \*lawyer was banging his head against the wall.\*  He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock this morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Royal Bank of Ireland '

1	"Little Bobby was running through the woods_____Little Bobby was running through the woods behind his house when the urge to go #2 struck. Bobby did his business behind a tree and carried on his way. The next day, Bobby was out behind his house again when he saw a swarm of flies circling yesterday's droppings. Intrigued, Bobby dropped his pants and did his business in the exact same spot in hopes of seeing how many flies he could gather. After a couple weeks of doing this, Bobby had created a rather tall pile of dung. So tall, in fact, that he now needed to use a step ladder to make sure he had a stable poo-pole developing. A curious neighbor caught sight of Bobby doing this, and after confronting Bobby, the neighbor punched Bobby in the face and told him to grow the hell up. Over the next few days, word of Bobby's droppings had spread around town. It started with just a few people a day coming up to Bobby, punching him in the face, and telling him the errs of his way. It wasn't long until there was a line of over 50 people waiting to see Bobby's poo-pole and to subsequently punch him in the face. The line moved pretty slowly, however, and someone towards the back of the line had to take care of some business of his own. Not wanting to leave his spot, he dropped his pants answered nature's call right then and there. The stench of his droppings spread quickly throughout the line. One gentleman towards the front of the line caught its stench when he saw Bobby's creation, admiration spreading across his face. The man at the front of the line turned around and said ""that was a good shit post, but this punchline stinks."""

He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic. When they got home, the mailman was dead on the porch.

As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place."" ""That's a great idea!"" says Einstein. ""Let's switch places then!"" So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it. But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response. The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says : ""Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me."""

1	A politician dies. Instead of going straight to heaven or hell, a spirit appears to him._____The spirit tells him that, rather than being judged for his sins, he gets to choose whether he goes to heaven or hell. The politician replies that of course he wants to go to heaven. The spirit tells him that before he chooses, he has to visit both places so each one will get a fair chance.First they visit heaven. It looks pretty nice. Big fluffy clouds, angels singing and playing harps, everyone seeming to enjoy themselves. The politician is pleased, if a bit underwhelmed.Hell, on the other hand, is magnificent. It’s the most beautiful place the politician has ever seen, and everyone there is having the time of their lives. It has a buffet table filled with delicious-smelling food, a beautiful garden, a pool with a water slide, a dance floor, a massage parlor, and innumerable other attractions. It makes heaven look dull and boring and comparison.“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” says the politician, “but I think I’d rather go to hell!” “Very well,” says the spirit. “Turn around.”When the politician turns around, though, hell appears to be completely different than it had been less than a minute ago. All of the attractions are gone, everything is on fire, and the people are screaming in agony.“I don’t understand!” cries the politician. “This isn’t what you showed me before!”“Well, that was the campaign,” replies the spirit. “Now you’ve voted.”

My 4th grade math teacher - and let me tell you, she was the best and smartest math teacher in the country at the time - my 4th grade math teacher said to me that I am the best counter she's ever seen.

One little boy stood up and offered: “If my best friend, who lives on a farm, is playing in the field and a tractor runs over him and kills him, that would be a tragedy.” “No,” said Trump, “that would be an accident” A little girl raised her hand: “If a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.” “I’m afraid not,” explained the president. “That’s what we would call great loss.” The room went silent. No other children volunteered. Trump searched the room. “Isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?” Finally at the back of the room a small boy raised his hand... In a quiet voice he said: “If ‘Air Force One’ was carrying you and was struck by a “friendly fire” missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.” “Fantastic!” exclaimed Trump. “That’s right. And can you tell me why that would be tragedy?” “Well,” said the boy, “It has to be a tragedy, because it certainly wouldn’t be a great loss, and it probably wouldn’t be a fucking accident either”.

Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!""The man said, ""Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.""

One for you, one for me.""The old man whispered, ""Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?"" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.At last, they heard, ""One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....""They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him."
1	"Stoner Joke. Three Men Died and Went to Hell Where They Met the Devil. (Warning! Long one)_____Three men died and went to hell where they met the Devil. The Devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 666 years in hell to atone for their sins. However, since the Devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 666 years. And so the Devil let the men to three doors.Going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. Although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. And even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available.  An unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. It was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.When they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. There were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. Looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. Every single one of them ready  to please you. It was, in short, a pervert's paradiseFinally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. The ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. There were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. You could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. It was, in short, a stoner's paradise.The Devil asked the men which room they each wanted. The words had barely left the Devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. The second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. Lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.666 years later, the Devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.When he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. It took the Devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. Not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the Devil to please let him out. There were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. The Devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.When the Devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. The Devil had not expected this. Confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong. The man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the Devil and said:""I don't have a lighter""Edit: a wordSneak note: ITT a lot of people who wants to ruin the joke :("

He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, to the old man.“Well, I don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a...” said the old man, and then he stopped.“Except what?” asked the businessman.“Nothing, nothing,” said the old man.“C’mon, tell me! I need something!” protested the businessman.“Well, sir, I don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.“The voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, “Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!”The old man said, “But you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”He pointed to a door and said “Voodoo dildo, the door.”The voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, “Voodoo dildo, box!”The voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.The businessman said, “I’ll take it!”The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “Voodoo dildo, my pussy.”He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.After he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. She lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “Voodoo dildo, my pussy!” The voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.After three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “Yeah, right. Voodoo dildo, my ass!"""

Most people would wish for a million or five million or whatever. This way, you’ll never run out of money, you don’t have to worry about carrying it, and you’ll never be robbed! Absolutely brilliant.”The man says, “I know, and thank you!”The bartender says, “So what did you ask for with your other two wishes?” The man said “A chick with long legs and a tight pussy.”

About a week afterwards, a body was found and brought into the coroner’s office. The coroner, after thoroughly examining the body, needed a positive identification in order to verify that the body was indeed Joe. So, he brought in Bro and Buddy, and told them to come in separately to identify the body. Bro came in first, and was asked to look for any details about the body that he recognized. After a few minutes of examining, Bro said, “Mr. Coroner, I’ll need you to turn the body over for me to be sure.”Confused, the coroner obliged. Bro continued to examine the body, bent down on one knee, reared his head sideways, then stood up and said, “No sir, this can’t be Joe.”The coroner was even more confused, but he accepted this statement and sent Bro out. Next, he invited Buddy in to repeat the task. Buddy, after examining the body in a similar fashion to Bro, also requested that the body be turned over.The coroner, after mumbling a bit about his confusion, flipped the body over. Buddy too bent down on one knee and examined the back area of the body, then, just as Bro had previously, said, “No sir, Mr. Coroner, this isn’t Joe.”The coroner was astonished, so he asked that Bro come back in so that the two of them were standing there at once. The coroner said, “Gentlemen, this man’s dental records and features match perfectly with those of your friend Joe’s. How on earth are you both positive this isn’t him?”Bro and Buddy looked at each other, then Bro answered, “Sir, this can’t be Joe because Joe has two assholes.”In shock, the coroner asked, “How can he have two assholes? Have you ever seen them?”Buddy replied, “No sir, but it was common knowledge. Every time we were out with him, people would say, ‘Look, it’s Joe with those two assholes!’”**Credit goes to my grandmother, who was the first to tell me this joke.**

We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”

""It's my job."" came the familiar reply. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly, as well. The salesman asked, ""How about new shoes?"". Joe was on a roll and agreed. The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, ""Let's see, nine-and-a-half?"" Joe was astonished, ""That's right, how did you know?"". ""It's my job."" said the salesman, again. Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly, again. He walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, ""How about some new underwear?"" Joe thought for a second and said, ""Sure, why not."" The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, ""Let's see, size 36."" Joe laughed smugly, ""No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."" The shocked salesman shook his head, ""You can't possibly wear a size 34! It would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."

While sipping his tequila, he noticed a sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at the next table. Not only did it look good, but the smell was wonderful.

1	A frog is born mute_____A frog is born mute so he can’t make any noises that a frog typically makes because, well, he can’t make any noises at all. So naturally it’s very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; a tortoise who’s had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop a system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, ‘do you want me to take you to the pond?’ The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can’t take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, ‘You like her, don’t you?’ The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, ‘You want me to go talk to her for you?’ The frog blinks twice for No. ‘I see,’ says the tortoise. ‘You wish you could talk to her yourself.’ The frog blinks once, a single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. ‘Well gee, my friend,’ says the tortoise. ‘We’ve been good friends for so long, I think I owe it to you to find a way to restore your voice.’ And with that the tortoise sets out.The tortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets a snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists.  The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there’s anything the snake can do for the frog.‘Yessssss,’ the snake replies. ‘There issss one sssurgery I can perform that may ressstore your friend’sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it’s very risssky. There’sss a fifty percent chance your friend won’t sssurvive the sssurgery.’ ‘Oh my,’ says the tortoise. ‘I’ll be sure to let him know!’ So the tortoise returns to the frog and tells him the news. ‘There’s this snake who might be able to restore your voice, but it’s a coin toss whether or not you survive the procedure. Do you want to go through with this?’ After a long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes. So a day is set aside for the surgery and on that day all of the creatures of the forest gather around the snake and the frog as the snake prepares his tools and the anesthesia starts to kick in. All the creatures of the forest look on anxiously, knowing that in just a few short moments they’re either going to hear their friend’s voice for the first time, or they’re going to lose him forever. And you’ll never guess what happened next. He croaked!

So then I snuck home and tried to put the whole nasty thing out my mind.Later that day however,  I heard shouting from next doors garden..he sounded angry as hell.  Nervously I looked out and casually asked him what was wrong.Purple and astonished he shouted back to me...""You never guess what??? The kid's rabbit died yesterday and today some sick fucker has dug it up and put it back in the hutch!!!"""

0	In the beginning, when Man was first created, all the members of the body held a meeting to decide who should be in charge._____The brain said that it should be in charge because it had the power of decision making and so controlled what everything else in the body did.  The eyes pointed out that they were the ones who saw everything, including whatever objectives the brain was going to decide to pursue, so they should be in charge.  The arsehole tried to say something at this point but was interrupted:  The ears said that they should be in charge because not even the eyes could look in all directions at once, whereas the ears were vigilant no matter which way the body was facing, and could even warn of danger when the eyes were shut.  The heart said this was all very well, but without the tireless work it did in bringing blood to all parts of the body neither the brain nor the eyes nor the ears would last half a minute, so the heart should be in charge.  Again the arsehole started to speak but was shouted down.   The stomach pointed out that it had to process food before the heart would have anything worth carrying around, so it ought to be in charge.  The hands said that they were the ones responsible for picking up whatever the brain decided on and the eyes saw, and without them the stomach would never get anything, so they should be in charge.  The legs commented that they were the ones actually responsible for taking the body from place to place, so they ought to be in charge.   The arsehole made a final attempt to put its case, but everyone else told it to piss off and shut the fuck up.  This upset the arsehole so it decided to go on strike and see how everyone else liked it. Pretty soon the brain was feeling faint, the eyes had spots before them, the ears were ringing, the heart was fluttering, the stomach was queasy, the hands were clammy and the legs were wobbly. They all asked the arsehole very politely to get back to work, but the arsehole said that they'd had their chance to be nice about it and there was no way it was going back to work unless it could be in charge. And while the other parts of the body tried to hold out, it soon became clear that unless the arsehole got its way things were going to just get worse and worse, so eventually there was nothing for it but to give in.   And from that day to this, whenever there is a body or organisation of any sort, there's always an arsehole in charge.

To the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.“No problem…just like Tampa in June,” the man says.So the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. He then goes back over to see how the Tampa man is doing. The man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.“No problem. Just like Tampa in July,” the man says.So now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. When he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. Otherwise, he seems OK.He says, “No problem. Just like Tampa in August.”Now the devil is really perplexed. So he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to MINUS 150 DEGREES. Immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning Hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.When he goes back now to see how the Tampa man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. The devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. To which the Tampa man replies…..“THE RAYS WON THE WORLD SERIES!!!”“THE RAYS WON THE WORLD SERIES!!!”

As well as a challenge!”His curious (also drunk) flock followed him out to what appeared to be a huge swimming pool filled with live alligators.“What is the meaning of this?!” Exclaimed one manThe rich man replied. “I have so much wealth that I do not know what to do with it. I have more money than one man could ever hope to spend. Alas I am bored!”“This is my 80 foot pool and it holds one hundred hungry alligators!” He proudly proclaimed.“I am prepared to pay a cash prize of $10,000,000 to anyone who can swim from one side to the other without being harmed!”His audience fell silent. No one was crazy (or drunk enough) to attempt such a feat.“You’re a madman!” One guest bellowed out.“A fools errand to be sure!” Another one shouted“Yes, yes, I suppose you’re right.” The rich man nodded.“ I did not expect anyone to be willing to throw away their life for mere dollars. Back inside I suppose”Just as the rich man and all of his guests are heading back inside the mansion, he hears a loud SPLASH.“Out of my way!” He yelled, as he pushed his way through the crowd back to the pool.Much to his surprise and disbelief, he sees a young man swimming for his life across the gator infested pool! The young man narrowly makes it to the other side safe and unharmed, climbs out of the water, doubles over hands on knees and begins to breath heavily. The rich man rushes over to him.“Are you insane?! He shrieks.“You could have died! Why would you even attempt such a stunt?! I mean the money is no problem, I’ll deliver it to you at once however, I must know what made you go for it? I’ve never seen anyone swim that fast in my life!”The young man, still catching his breath, picks himself up to stand straight, wrings his soaked shirt, and slicks his hair back, looks the rich man dead in his face and angrily says....“Who the fuck pushed me!”

0	Little Johnny won’t quit swearing. NSFW_____My dad told me this joke many many years ago. It is by far my favorite little Johnny joke. I’ve searched the archives of Reddit and haven’t seen it posted before so here goes:Little Johnny’s parents were having problems with him swearing and couldn’t get him to stop, so his dad goes to a psychiatrist and tells him the issue. The psychiatrist says “as you know, Christmas is coming up so what I want you to do is tuck little Johnny into bed on Christmas Eve and ask him what he wants for Christmas. Every time he swears, replace that gift with a pile of dog shit. He dad replies “well that seems strange, but I’m out of options so I’ll give it a shot.” So Christmas Eve creeps up and little Johnny’s dad is tucking him into bed. He asks little Johnny, “What do you want for Christmas this year?”Little Johnny replies “ When I wake up Christmas morning I wanna see a god damn teddy bear laying right next fucking next to me on this pillow. When I go downstairs, I wanna see a fucking choo choo train wrapped around the god damn Christmas tree, and when I go outside I wanna see a big fucking red bike in my god damn garage.”His dad says “Ok little Johnny. See you Christmas morning.”Christmas morning comes and little Johnny wakes up and rolls over in bed. He sees a pile of dog shit. “What the fuck?” He goes down stairs and sees dog shit all over around the Christmas tree. He screams “What the fuck is this!?” He goes outside and sees a big pile of dog shit sitting in the garage. He is sitting there cursing up a storm and his dad walks out as asks, “So little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas this year?”Little Johnny says “I think I got a fucking puppy but I can’t find that son of a bitch!”

The day was celebrated in his honour and every year when it came around the villagers would worship his name.Over the years the memory of Urkake faded and only a few people remembered the great feat he had achieved.If you look around today you will probably find that nobody cares if its Urkake day.

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7."""

At least twice a week, Stanley went out in the woods with his hunting buddies Cletus and Jimmy. They never shot much, but they always had a few cases handy and always had a good time. They were practically inseparable and were often seen bumbling around town together.Now, one day Stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. The can exploded, Stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. After the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. The entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was Stanley, it'd be Cletus and Jimmy.The mortician called Cletus in to identify the body. ""Thank you for coming in, Cletus,"" she said gently. ""I know this isn't easy for you and I appreciate you taking the time."" Cletus replied in a somber tone. ""No trouble at all, ma'am."" The mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing Stanley's horribly burned frontside. She asked Cletus if this was indeed Stanley.""Weeeeeeeell,"" said Cletus. ""I don't know. I really can't tell. Why don't you flip him on over?"" The mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing Stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. Without hesitation, Cletus exclaimed, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley!"" The mortician was surprised, but thanked Cletus again for his time and sent him on his way.She then called Jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. As with Cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. Then she pulled back the sheet and asked Jimmy if he could confirm it was Stanley.""Weeeeeeell,"" Jimmy said pensively. ""Hard to say. Would it be alright if you flip him over?"" The mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. After only a second, Jimmy said confidently, ""Nope, that ain't Stanley."" The mortician was dumbfounded.""I have to ask,"" she said. ""Why on earth did you want me to flip the body over? Cletus said the exact same thing!""Jimmy replied, ""Well you see miss, this man's only got one asshole.""""One asshole?!"" the mortician cried.

At last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  The police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.

This breathalyser equipment must be broken."" ""I doubt it,"" said the truly proud man, ""tonight I'm the designated decoy."""

I took a seat and just as she was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. She made me promise not to touch the blindfold until she returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my wife was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my wife returned, apologizing for taking so long. She asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured her I had not. At this point, she removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!"""

0	You're Not a Monk_____A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m \*dying\* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.” The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?” The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man demands the key to the stone door. So, the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst. Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.&#x200B;But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.&#x200B;

0	"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam..._____His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note...And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note. People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. Words cannot do justice to the experience. The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday. All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note. From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted! The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. Soon the entire monastery was aflame. By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.The mayor approached the lead monk of the order. ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7."""

We’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”“Actually, I think I’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “Sorry, we have rules…” at which St. Peter put the HR manager into the downward bound elevator.As the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.They played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.Before she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. “Now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.So she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day’s end St. Peter returned. “So,” he said, “You’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “You must choose between the two.”The woman thought for a second and replied: “Well, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.”Accordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.“I don’t understand,” stuttered the HR manager, “The other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”The Devil simply looked at her and smiled, “Yesterday we were recruiting you, today you’re staff.”

0	The Story of Mike Doe_____Hey, my name’s Mike Doe, and this is my story. I had a friend in college, my freshman roommate, who was always talking about his family. His name was Robert Gooding, and he must’ve had a family tree that started from Adam and Eve. Every single day he would drone on and on about some cousin or uncle or some such. He would always burst into the room saying things like, “Hey Mike! You’ll never guess Uncle Nate and Aunt Ridley are doing in Taiwan for the orphans this week!” I remember him talking about how Dimitri, his mother’s grandfather’s nephew’s son, which is apparently what second cousin once removed means, had resolved a tense hostage situation in Iran. And how cool Auntie Pauline (actually a distant cousin) was for working on top secret stuff with the CIA. I always tried to be patient with him and at least pretended to listen and nod at his stories. They never seemed to be about the same people. Sometimes he’d mention something that was actually funny or interesting too so it wasn’t always bad.Good old rambling Robert. He picked up that nickname within a couple weeks of starting school--I don’t think he liked it much. He didn’t make many friends because he could never stop talking about his own family. Sometimes I think that I was the only one he could talk to who wouldn’t start running after five minutes. I’m not going to lie though. Back then I endeavored to be out of the room most of the day to avoid his ramblings. However no matter how late I came back, he was always up and ready to tell me something new about his family’s latest adventures.There was this one time that was different though. On a day close to the end of our first semester together, he suddenly stopped his rambling and stared at me with a really serious expression. The abrupt lack of background noise startled me from the article I was reading while humoring him, and when I saw his face I thought he must have been angry with me for ignoring him. “You know Michael,” he started as I prepared my apology, “I really appreciate that you listen to my stories every day. I know it must be boring and annoying for you, but you listen anyway and I appreciate that. So I want to promise you something. Us Goodings, we don’t forget stuff like this. We take care of our friends. Just you wait, one day me and the whole family will find a way to thank you.” I shuddered at the thought of having to attend a graduation party with his entire family and hear about all their adventures first hand, but at that moment I realized that Robert was actually a pretty good guy.Our year together came to an end, and the next year I was assigned a different roommate. Rambling Robert still sent me emails to keep me up to date with all his family happenings for a while, but even those stopped when he decided to transfer out to some college in Washington. I completed my degree in criminal psychology and went on to work as a detective for the DEA for a while. I had a great time there busting drug dealers and cleaning up the streets of my hometown, and my mom was so proud to have a real Officer Doe in the family. I was about 45 years old when they promoted me and had me relocated near the Mexican border to work on the drug traffic coming from the cartels. It was there that I finally met one of Robert’s infamous family members, Randall Gooding. He was my new supervisor, and when I showed up on the first day he greeted me like an old friend. He told me that he recognized my name and background from the stories Robert had told him, and he personally requested that I be sent down. I was surprised that Robert even talked about me, we had only known each other for a year, but it was nice to reminisce about the Goodings again. Randall was just as talkative as Robert was, and we hit it off almost immediately. It felt like I was in college again. His nickname around the office was Rambling Randy, which had me chuckling for at least a day. Robert, it turns out, was doing just fine. He was a doctor now somewhere in Texas, and I was happy that my old friend was able to make such a good life for himself.Work was good for a few years until the cartel activity started to pick up dramatically. Nobody was sure why but we were suddenly inundated with arrests and busts and all kinds of paper work. Even Randy wasn’t as talkative around this time. It was all supposed to come to a head today. Today we were going to do a massive takedown on a processing plant operating just inside the border. Our undercover agent had uncovered it while posing for a different case so Randy and I took the lead while the rest of the office continued monitoring the other operation. We enlisted the FBI and local SWAT teams for help and I thought everything was going to go smoothly until I got kidnapped right out of the parking lot on my way out of the office last night.From the time they ripped the rucksack bag off of my head till the first rays of daylight, they questioned me. They were careful. All of them had clown masks on, the hard plastic kind that never quite fit the face right. All of them were wearing gloves and carrying weapons--some had guns, some had various wicked modifications of baseball bats and crowbars. The night was rough. They wanted to know how we found out about them, who we were working with, when the operation was going to go down, and a whole host of other questions. I was patient and waited. I gave them no information and suffered a few broken ribs and some teeth for it. While they were questioning me, I took in my surroundings. I knew from the floor plans I had studied for the bust that I was in the processing plant, specifically in one of the raised offices at the end of the building. I could see the entire plant from the large window on the wall in front of me. I guessed that they did not know about our plans yet, so I contented myself to sit tight and wait for the bust to happen at 10AM.However, it was around 6AM when I heard the sirens blaring in the distance. Maybe they stepped up the schedule when they found out I was kidnapped, I thought. My captors were awake in an instant and took up the preplanned positions we had predicted. One of the guys carrying what looked like an M16 came cursing into the office where I was being held. After cracking me in the face with the butt of the gun, I felt more than heard him raise the muzzle level with the back of my head. Soon I heard an unfamiliar voice yell over a megaphone giving the normal spiel about being surrounded and to give up. Of course they refused to give up and began to use me as a bargaining chip. Randy’s voice came over the megaphone just before the first officer continued the negotiation, “Mikey! Just wait Mikey! Hang tight and don’t do anything stupid.”The standoff lasted for hours. If it weren’t for the gun pressed on the nape of my neck, I would have probably passed out from boredom. Eventually things got real quiet. My guard started getting antsy and walked out--probably to check for new orders with his superiors. As soon as he left the room, a hundred glass windows shattered breaking the silence and raining shards of glass down on the main factory floor. White smoke obscured the first floor as tear gas flooded the facility. Shouting and gunfire followed as my captors opened fire. Amid the confusion and smoke I couldn’t tell who was winning. I did hear Randy’s voice at one point yelling orders like, “Dimitri, take the stairs and give Pauline some cover.” None of the officers who were supposed to be with us today were named Dimitri or Pauline. The din began to wither after only a few minutes and unseen officers began yelling, “Clear!” As the smoke dissipated, I expected to see the body armor and face masks of the SWAT teams who were supposed to be part of today’s operation. Instead I saw lots of men and a few women I had never seen before in various uniforms. Some were in army uniforms others were in suits, and there were even a few in civilian clothes. God, did they call the Army and CIA in on this? When Randy saw me, he came running up with one of the suited men who was carrying a bag.“Mike! Thank God you’re still alive. I’m sorry we made you wait so long, but we had to wait for all the flights to make it before we could move.”“What? What flights? Randy, what are you talking about?”“We found out you were kidnapped at about midnight. The team that we were going to use wasn’t trained for hostage situations so I had to improvise. I made some calls around and got as many as I could to come down here. Good thing Nate here happened to have hostage experience. Nobody asked any questions after I brought your name up, we all know you thanks to Robert here.” He motioned at the suited man who was leaning in to assess me.I frowned at the man and suddenly realized that his bag contained medical supplies. “Robert?” I choked the question out in disbelief. He just gave me a small smile while he continued his work. “You mean to tell me that all of these guys… They’re all your family?”Robert looked up from where he was examining my jaw with a wry smile, “I told you we don’t forget Mike. All the Goodings come to Doe’s who wait. ”

The buddhist said ""I will jump off this cliff but as I call to Buddha I will not be harmed.""So the Buddhist jumps off the cliff and calls to Buddha. ""Buddha Buddha Buddha Buddha"" he yells. When he was near the ground his fall started to slow down until eventually he levitated. The Muslim, unimpressed by the Buddhist said that Allah can grant him the power of flight. So he jumped off.As he falls he calls for Allah.""Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.""As he nears the ground his calls became desperate.""Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!""The ground broke his fall.The Buddhist, while still levitating, nods to the Christian to tell him it's his turn.Surely the Lord will save me from any harm he says to himself. So he jumps off the cliff and prays to god.""Lord Jesus Lord God Holy Spirit save me save me"" he said as he was falling.Midway to the ground he calls for the blessed mary and the saints for help.""Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Mary please save me please save me.""As he was getting dangerously close to the ground he said;""Oh lord jesus, god, hol- BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA BUDDHA."""
0	You are not a monk_____A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”The man says, “All right, all right. I’m *dying* to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, “I have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. There are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”The monks reply, “Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.”The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is right behind that door.”The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, “Real funny. May I have the key?”The monks give him the key, and he opens the door.Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.The man demands the key to the stone door.The monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.He demands another key from the monks, who provide it.Behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire.So it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.Finally, the monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”The man is relieved to no end.He unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.But I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk.

When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station.The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house--there wasn't even a sofa. So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife tapped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. ""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. ""Your husband is my best friend!"" ""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" ""I can't believe that,"" Charlie said. ""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? ""He certainly won't. If you don't believe me, pluck a hair out of his ass and see if that wakes him."" Charlie did just that. Reached over and yanked. He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her. When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. Again he yanked a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's ass hairs. The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke and muttered: ""Listen, Charlie, old pal, I don't mind you fucking my wife, but please stop using my ass for a scoreboard!"""

The salesperson brought out a second item, whereupon the gentleman asked the price and was told it was $250. “That’s still not sheer enough”, replied the man - “bring me out the sheerest nightgown that you have.”. When the third nightgown arrived and he saw how thin it was he ponied up the $500 that was on the price tag.When he brought it home he excitedly asked his wife to try it on. She obliged and headed upstairs to change. She noticed the sales receipt for $500 in the box and thought to herself, “My goodness-this is so sheer that I doubt he’ll even be able to tell if I’m wearing it. I’ll just stand naked at the top of the stairs, return the item and spend the $500 on something that I really like.”  She shed all of her clothes and headed out to the top of the stairs, calling to her husband, twirling around and asking him what he thought of the nightgown.

The decision that if he was to ever decisively win the war for all herbivore-and-animal-kind, he must sever every head of the hydra at once. As he makes his way to his seat past the hundreds of wealthy CEO’s, each with the smug smirk of an easy victory wiped across their faces, his heart begins to pound rapidly. *WHY ON GOD’S GREEN EARTH DID I EVER DECIDE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THIS* His profuse sweat is noticeably visible to the jurors, who can’t help but shake their heads in dismay at a case that was all but finished before it ever began.

He even goed to the governor, but he gets told Church isn't doing anything wrong.The week rolls by, and the Friars grow more successful as Tony gets closer to broke. Finally, in desperation, he hires the meanest, baddest, most nasty man in town, Hue, and sends him after the Friars.Hue scares all the firars, smashes all their tables, rips up the garden beds, and even pisses all over the remaining flowers. The next day, the Friars are no longer selling flowers, and Tony is back in business. In the end, it seems the saying is true:Hue and only Hue can prevent florist friars."

In the room, he sees a huge wall, covered in clocks. Each clock has only one hand, and each hand has a name written on it. Some clocks are moving rather slowly, while others go a full circle in less than ten seconds. The man asks one of the angels there about the strange wall. The angel responds:""Each clock in this room represents a country back on Earth. You see, each clock has the country's name written on the hand, and each time a person from that country commits a sinful act, the hand on said clock goes forward a bit. The bigger the country the bigger the clock.""Intrigued by this, the man seeks out the clock of his own country, Canada. And what do you know, there it is, going forward one step at a time. He looks at all the other clocks, like Russia, the biggest if them all. Right next to Russia is tiny Estonia, and next to that Finland, Sweden and Norway, all going steadily forward, almost simultaneously.But one clock is missing. The man asks the angel, ""Where is the American clock? I thought it would be pretty big, but I can't see it anywhere.""The angel responds:""Ah yes, that one. An arrangement was made to have that one transferred to hell.""The man asks:""Huh? Why is that?"" To which the angel responds:""It's being used as the ceiling fan in the smoking room."" "

0	"Four friends walk into a forest..._____This is my favourite and go-to joke and further elaborations and movements fitting those of the fourth person add to the joke:Four friends walk into a forest and close to the path they walk on they see a fairy trapped beneath a fallen tree. They decide to help her out and once they have lifted the tree the fairy thanks all of them and says: ""I will grant all four of you 3 wishes but you need to make those after a time span of 3 years each.""                                           The first one answers: ""I would like to have 1000$ in cash right now!""                                                                                    The fairy says: ""No problem!"" and hands the first guy his thousand dollars.                                                          The second guy continues to make his wish: ""My ford fiesta is a nice car but I would really like to drive an Audi A6""                  ""Your wish shall become truth and the Audi is already parked in your garage at home."", says the fairy.                                     Guy Nr. 3 is now at the row to make his wish: ""My flat isn't really that big and I definitely need more space if I want to start a family, so I would like to own a nice single-family house in the suburbs with a nice little garden.""                                                       ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys to your new house and its address are inside of your letterbox back at your flat.""The last of the friends now asks the fairy: ""You know what would be really cool? If my head was spinning around in circles.""         ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys head starts to spin around in circles.                                                                                          Three years later the four friends meet up again to see the fairy and make their second wishes.                                                Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""The thousand dollars you gave me were really nice but after only 3 weeks I had already spent them so this time I wish for a million dollars in my bank account!""                                                                        ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The money you wish for is now in your bank account.""                                                               The second one now makes his turn: ""The Audi you gave me handles really well and it's also pretty fast but I would really enjoy a faster car. This time I wish for a Porsche!""                              ""No problem"", says the fairy. ""Additionally to your Audi I now placed a Porsche in your garage.""                                       The third guy proceeds: ""The house I wished for is quite beautiful but I would like to have a bit more room and luxury. I wish for a big mansion close to the sea!""                                                                                                                                                        ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The keys and location of your mansion are now placed in a letter sent to your current address.""                                                  The fourth guy, still spinning his head, now makes his wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head is now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my left arm was also spinning around in circles!""                                    ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys left arm now begins to spin.Three years later the four friends meet up one last time to see the fairy and make their final wishes.                                                Once arrived the first guy makes his wish: ""Being a millionaire is a really nice thing but it would be quite awesome to be the richest guy in the world!""                                                                        ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""You are now the richest man in the world and all the money in the world summed up is now in your bank account.""                                                               The second one now makes his turn: ""The Porsche you gave me is really fast and way more fun to drive than the Audi but I wish to have the ability to get all sports cars and luxury cars I wish for!""                              ""No problem"", says the fairy. ""I expanded your garage and whenever you wish for a car it's already inside next to all the other sporty cars and you will be able to drive a different sports car every day of the year.""                                       The third guy now proceeds: ""I really enjoy living in that big mansion by the sea but the only thing that would be even better would be my very own island with an even bigger mansion on it.""                                                                                                                   ""No problem"", says the fairy, ""The boatsman on your private yacht will take you to your very own private island.""                                                                                                                                                             The fourth guy, still spinning his head and his left arm, now makes the final wish: ""You know fairy, it's pretty awesome that my head and my left arm are now spinning all the time but it would be really really cool if my right arm was also spinning around the whole time in the opposite direction as my left arm!""                                            ""No problem"", says the fairy and the last guys right arm now begins to spin.The four friends now meet each other in a bar after another three years has passed. And they start to talk about what has happened since the fairy granted them the wishes.                                                                      The first guy starts talking about his life: ""My wealth is now big enough that there isn't a word to describe the number it has reached since I invested and multiplied it that often!""                                                                                           ""That's pretty awesome"", says the second guy, ""I now drive the newest prototype cars since experiencing a different car every day gave me the ability to give the best of feedback to the car manufacturers while I even get paid for driving  those multi-million dollar cars around.""                                                                                                                                                                           The third guy now speaks about his very own wealth: ""I now own 50 additional islands and have built the most luxurious holiday resorts and earn a lot of money through that.""

0	"I went to a new restaurant that I'd seen. It was called ""Tentacles With Everything""._____So I went in and asked for a table for one, and the waiter came over after a while and said ""Would sir prefer squid or octopus?"" and I said ""What?"" and he said ""Perhaps sir is new here... we specialize in squid and octopus, nothing else. Is this perhaps a new culinary experience for sir?""  Now I've eaten both *polpo* and *calamari* in posher joints than this, so I wasn't about to let this guy lord it over me, and I said ""Not at all. Is there a special of the day?"" and he said ""Not really, but we do have some very good squid in at the moment,"" so I said, ""All right, squid it is then."" And then we got down to the details.  ""Farmed squid or wild?"" -- well, there was only one choice here, so I asked for wild, obviously.  ""Green squid or purple?"" -- I asked the waiter for his recommendation, and he suggested green, so that was fine by me.  ""Smooth lipped or hairy?"" -- well, that threw me, but he assured me that you don't actually eat the hairy bit, and if it was him then that's what he'd have been eating. Okay, hairy it was.   So he took my order and said, ""Very well, sir, we'll just get you the squid of your choice out of the tank and Jervaise will cook it up for you."" In the meantime there were a few pretzels to munch on and I was fine with that.  Ten minutes or so later the waiter came back with a martini, which I hadn't ordered, and he said ""I'm so sorry, sir, there is a bit of a hold-up here. Jervaise, I regret to say, is one of these temperamental sorts, and he says he will cook a dead squid to perfection, but he will not kill a live squid, and someone else must do it. Temperamental, I say, sir, but confidentially, I believe he is just too faint-hearted for the task. However, all is not lost. Our *plongeur*, Hans, is a very down-to-earth type and I am sure he will do the necessary when he starts his shift, and in the meantime would you care to accept this drink with the compliments of the management?""  Well, martini is not my usual tipple, but when someone else is paying I suppose it is worth a try, and I sat there sipping at the martini and toying idly with the bar snacks while I was waiting, and after a while I saw, without much surprise, that the waiter was coming back.  He was full of apologies and assured me that there would be no charge for anything I had consumed, but, long story short, squid was off the menu tonight. Despite being supposedly down-to-earth and full of Teutonic bluntness, when Hans was handed the squid and the meat cleaver he proved completely unable to bear the trusting gaze of the unfortunate cephalopod, and the squid had been returned to the tank while the plate-washer went for a little sit-down and a quiet sob.  And I summed up as I thought best: ""now, Hans that does dishes can be soft as Jervaise with wild green hairy-lipped squid."""

0	"Lions eat anything_____A bloke starts his new job at the zoo and is given three tasks. The first is to clear the exotic fish pool of weeds. As he does this, a huge fish jumps out and bites him. To show the others who is the boss, he beats it to death with a spade. Realizing his employer won't be best pleased, he disposes of the fish by feeding it to the lions, as lions will eat anything.Moving on to the second job of clearing out the chimpanzee house, he is attacked by the chimps and pelt him with coconuts. He swipes at two chimps with a spade, killing them both. What can he do? Feed them to the lions, he says to himself, because lions eat anything. He hurls the corpses into the lion enclosure.He moves on to the last job, which is to collect honey from the South American Bees. As soon as he starts he is attacked and stung by the bees. He grabs the spade and smashes the bees to a pulp. By now he knows what to do and throws them into the lion's cage - because lions eat anything.Later that day a new lion arrives at the zoo. He wanders up to another lion and says, ""What's the food like here?"" The other lions say, ""Absolutely brilliant.So far today we've had fish and chimps with mushy bees."""

0	"The Poor Snake Named Nate_____ So... Nate the Snake was the king of the jungle, by virtue of his   immense size. Nate was the size of a freight train, and had a similar outlook on life. He ruled largely through terror and intimidation.  One day Nate the Snake was rumbling through the jungle, as was his own. Whenever Nate slithered, the earth shook, trees fell, and birds plummeted from the sky. Nate was out surveying his domain, and took a spin though the local village.  Now, normally when Nate visited the village, everyone hid from him, in stark, abject, raving terror. A sort of ""hide the women and children, bury the silver in the backyard"" sort of terror. And today was no different: as Nate the Snake rolled through town, no one was on the streets, and the village seemed abandoned.  Except for one man.  At the far end of town, a man was standing next to a tree. Nate the Snake was bemused by this, as -- as has been mentioned -- people normally hid from him -- or at least ran screaming. But this man stood his ground. This piqued Nate's curiosity, so he rumbled and slithered up to the man. and Asked him ""Why aren't you hiding? Aren't you afraid of me?""  ""Of course I'm afraid of you, but my job is more important.""  ""Oh?"" said Nate ""And what's your job?""  ""I'm the lever man. I guard the lever tree.""  ""The lever tree?""  ""You see this lever here, in the side of the tree? If anyone flips this lever, it will destroy the entire world. My job is to keep an eye on the lever, and make sure no one touches it.""  ""Doesn't that get awfully boring?""  ""Yes, yes it does... it's been years since I've seen my family.""  Never let it be said that Nate the Snake did not have a soft side. He took pity on the man and offered to keep an eye on the lever for him, so he could take a few days off and visit his family. The man gratefully ran screaming away in terror. And life returned to normal.  Eventually Nate the Snake, who was a somewhat ADD snake, got bored and decided to cruise around the jungle some more. He figured that the word was pretty well out that the lever tree was being guarded by Nate the Snake, and he decided that it was quite unlikely that anyone would mess with the lever in his absence.  A little while later, Nate heard a rumbling. Thinking it might be his tail end, he stopped. Once his entire body had stopped, he still heard the rumbling. And then he panicked: what if the rumbling had something to do with the lever tree?  So, Nate the Snake rumbled and slithered his way back to the village as fast as he could. As he came over the rise, he saw what was making the rumbling noise: a gigantic steamroller. The local highway department was improving the road, bunging an 8 lane mega-highway through the middle of the village.  The huge steamroller was headed right for the lever tree. Nate bellowed for the driver to stop, but the driver couldn't hear him over the rumble of the steamroller. Nate rushed towards the man, trying to get his attention, but the man was focused on the steamroller. Finally, in a fit of desperation, Nate the Snake through himself in front of the steamroller.  This got the driver's attention: he felt a bump big enough to notice. He stopped the steamroller to get down and take a look at what he had hit. When he got down, he saw that he had run over Nate the Snake and squashed him flat. As he started to panic, he looked around and saw that his steamroller was bare inches from the lever tree.  The steamroller driver breathed a sigh of relief and exclaimed, ""Better Nate than lever.""  *Budump bum.* "

0	Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft..._____...The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.

1	An ancient mathematical joke_____Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. For centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. One day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.The first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. The night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. The second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. The night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.The third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. The night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.The next day, the battle began. All the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. The squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. So, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought.The battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. The lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.And it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

I could see she was not wearing a bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show.      After watching her walk in I turned back to my beer. No sooner had I taken a sip when I turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said 'Hi', and I said 'Hi' in return. She asked how I was and took my hand and placed it on her perfect inner thigh, rubbing it up and down.      'So, does that make you feel good ?' she asked. ..'I'll bet you feel good,' she continued. 'In fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before.''Well, I have,' I corrected her. 'You see, when I was 17, I was picked to play for the school 1st. XV in the National School Finals in front of a crowd of about 3000 and I felt really good.'I immediately felt a bit pathetic saying that and I thought she would get up and go. But she took my hand off her thigh and put it up the front of her top. Her nipple pushed into my palm as she massaged my hand into her pert, perfect breast.'How do you feel now,' she purred.'OK' I replied.Again, she said, 'I'll bet you do. In fact, I'll bet you've never felt THIS good before!'Unbelievably I heard myself saying 'Well, actually I have. In that game, we were down by six points with about 20 seconds left in the match.The Opposition kicked the ball deep into our half of the field, where I caught it. I ran up field, side-stepping past the first few defenders, handed off a couple of would-be tacklers, burst through a few forwards, chipped over their fullback, regathered and scored a try right under the posts with about 2 or 3 seconds 'til full time. We were still behind by one point, but I had a simple kick at goal to win the match.”      ""Ahhh...."" she growled between clenched teeth, more than a bit miffed, pulled my hand from under her top and thrust it down the front of her skirt.My fingers immediately met what felt like a wisp of soft cotton , and she was wet !She whispered, 'Well tell me this, Mr. Rugby Man: Have you ever felt such a perfect c*nt?''I certainly have,' I answered,'I missed the kick.'"

The leader of the warriors approaches the two friends and informs them they are trespassing on sacred land and unless they can prove they are descendants of the Gods they will be killed and eaten.Bob and Frank realize they have little choice but agree they will attempt any test to try to save their lives. The chief warrior brings them a bowl full of angry fire ants and drops three small seeds into the bowl. He informs them they must put their lips in the bowl and suck as hard as they can. If they manage to suck up all three seeds without sucking up an ant then the tribe would know they must be sent from the Gods. Bob looks wearily at Frank but knowing they have no other options he puts his lips in the bowl and sucks hard. He immediately gets a mouth full of ants and screams in pain as they bite away at the inside of his mouth. Frank now even more nervous takes his turn and to his dismay also receives a nasty mouthful of the viscous buggers. The warriors leap to their feet and surround the friends, “Now you must die” declares the chieftain. Just as the first spear is raised to Franks throat he screams “Tria-Gan!” The warriors stop dead in their tracks. “What did you say” asked the chief. “Tria-Gan” yelled frank again. Immediately the chief and his warriors turned and fled into the forest.“Holy shit” said Bob “What did you just say and how did you know it would work?”“Well” said Frank,  “my Mother always told me if at first you don’t suck seeds try Tria-Gan.”

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

1	"An American, an Indian, and a Russian got in Hell and plead to the Devil that they don't belong here. The Devil, bored, makes them an offer: ""I will strike you 3 times with my whip, and if you survive, I'll let you go. You can use anything you want as a shield""._____The American goes first. He builds a high-tech shield from depleted uranium and composites, and hides behind it. The Devil strikes once - the shield cracks; twice - the shield falls apart; thrice - the American is no more. Next goes the Indian. He puts himself in some advanced Yoga position and goes into deep hibernation. The Devil strikes once - nothing; twice - the Indian shivers a bit; thrice - the Indian grunts, but lives.The Devil is amazed and tells him he's free to go. The Indian asks ""May I stay and watch? In all jokes the Russians somehow come out on top. I want to see how he will do it this time"".The Devil nods and turns to the Russian: ""So, what will you use as a shield?""The Russian: ""The Indian, of course""."

0	"Purple box_____is kid is walking to school one day when a man jumps out of the bushes at him, yells ""PURPLE BOX!"" then dies. The kid – lets just call him The Kid from now on – was pretty shaken up by the experience. I mean its not every day a crazy old man yells you and dies, but not knowing what to do he continues on his way to school. When he gets there he tries to forget about it and goes about his business until recess comes.All the kids go out to play and do whatever it is little children do. (Susie was playing hopscotch, Steven was on the swings, ect) That's when the kid told his friend Jimmy about the the old man. ""Hey Jimmy, today i was walking to school when an old man walked up to me and yelled ""Purple Box"" then-"" as soon as he heard ""Purple Box"" Jimmy froze, his face turned to horror and he ran off, leaving no explanation and a very confused Kid. A few minutes the bell rang and The Kid goes back to class where hes stopped by his teacher. ""Jimmy said you told him a naughty story at recess today, is this true?"" The Kid had no idea what she meant by ""naughty story"" so he tried to explain it, but as soon as he got to the end of the story the teacher look down at him with the most appalled look you ever seen and said ""Young man, i have never heard such rude language in my life! Go to the office right now!""So hes in the office and the principal says to him ""Son I've been told you've been sent down to my office because of a story?"" The Kid looks at him a little scared and tells him the story ""Well today I was walking to school when a man walked up to me and said ""Purple Box"", then he died. I told Jimmy and he freaked out. I told the teacher and she sent me here. whats the big deal with the purple box?"" The principal looked down at him with a look of disgust. ""Young man you are going home right now! you are expelled from this school"" and the kid goes home.When he gets there his mother asks him why he home and he tells her about the Purple Box. She looks down on him says ""how dare you use that kind of language in front of your mother! Go to your room right now!"" A few hours later his dad walks into his room and and asks what wrong, The kid tells him, ""Today a man walked up to me said ""Purple Box"" then died. I told Jimmy, and he freaked out. I told my teacher, and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told mom and she sent me to my room."" His dad gets up leaves the room and doesn't come back for several hours. When he does come back he has a briefcase with him and he says, ""Son this briefcase has 10,000 dollars in it. I want you to take it and never come back to this house again"" So The Kid is crushed, they packs his bags, they buy him a plane ticket to china, and they send him on his way.On the plane one of the stewardesses called him over to come see the cockpit. (One of those ""hey lets make some random kids day"" things you see on tv and shit.) So he goes up, they show him some buttons and flashy bits, and eventually the reason for why hes on the plane in the first place comes up, so The Kid tells them about the old man and the Purple box. The pilot, after hearing the story says, ""There's a parachute in the back of the fuselage. I want you to take it and get the hell off my plane."" They escort him to the back of the plane, strap him in, and toss him out 10,000 feet over the Atlantic ocean.The kid opens his parachute just fine – evidently there is such a thing as natural talent when it comes to jumping out of an airplane – and floats down to an island where he meets an old castaway. They talk for a while – make friends even – and then he tells him about the old man. ""Well, I was walking to school when an old man jumped out at me and yelled ""Purple Box."" I told my friend Jimmy and he freaked out. I told my teacher and she sent me to the office. I told the office and they sent me home. I told my parents and they sent me on a plane. I told the pilot and he kicked off the plan. Please, please tell me. Whats a Purple Box?Now the old man sat there for a while, looking all deep and thoughtful. Then he turned to The kid and said, ""Theres a raft on the other side of the island. I spent 6 years making it, but I want you to take it and sail west to New York. There, you will find a Purple Box.So the kid sets off on an epic adventure across the Atlantic ocean. He fights pirates, wrestles sharks, punches C'thulu in the face, That sort on thing. Until eventually he makes it to New York. The Kid doesn't know where to start so he goes to the top of the empire state building to get a better view. When he peers over the edge of the building he sees a big, bright, sign that says ""Purple Box Here."" Now The Kid is so exited he completely ignores the elevator, bolts down the stairs, runs across the street, and gets hit by a bus.Moral of the story: Look both ways before crossing.Tl;Dr: What a twist!"

0	There is a store in Spain that sells exquisite handmade writing instruments._____This store has all kinds of bespoke fountain pens and rollerball pens and even ball point pens. There are pens made of fine hard woods and precious metals inlaid with all kinds of gems. These pens are all handmade by artisans who have been in the business for generations.But what really sets this shop apart is their ink master. Most people buy pens with black ink or blue ink or even red ink, mostly because they do not know the world of colors of ink available at this shop. These fine inks are carefully blended by this ink master, a prodigy among those with a sense for color. There are colors so deep you feel you could fall into them, so vibrant you'd think they were alive, and so bright you'd think they were on fire. Every color imaginable and some you can't even imagine are available here. However the ink master is rarely at the store, he travels the world sourcing ingredients for his magnificent inks. Velvet Red ink made from the shell of a Japanese beetle. Royal blue ink made from the petals of an African flower that only blooms once every four years. Making sure these ingredients are available for his customers keeps this whiz of ink away for months sometimes years at a time.But while people come from all over the world to buy this artisan ink maker's products, very few ever actually think they'll get a chance to meet him.Because nobody expects the Spanish ink whiz is in.

0	"The Brick_____Those askreddit threads reminded me of this old one.A man is building a house out of bricks. When it's finished he walks inside and finds a random brick in the middle of a room on the floor. Thinking to himself: ""I know I used every last brick to build this house. I wonder where this brick came from?"" He calls into the house his partner who helped him build the house and shows him the brick. The other man shrugs, picks up the brick, opens a window and throws the brick out of the window! Just like that, the man couldn't believe it!Across town, a bus was setting off on a long journey. On the bus was a man opening his book and settling in for the long journey ahead. After only a few minutes into the ride, a *yap yap yap* noise came from the seats behind him. The yapping continued until, fed up, the man jumped up and scowled over the seat to the woman behind him and her yapping dog. He bellows, ""Can you please quiet your dog!"" The woman returns his scowl with one of her own and says ""No! I will not silence my pet, it is a dog and I'm allowed to have it and dogs yap! Mind your own business!"" The man returns to his side of the seat and opens his window in hopes the fresh air helps calm him, and the sound of the wind drowns out the annoying yaps. *yap yap yap* The man lights up a cigar and begins to smoke. Taking long pulls and blowing the smoke making sure it's blown directly in the woman's direction.He feels a tap on his shoulder. The woman from the seat behind him is standing over his seat and coughing, she says: ""put that out! It's making me and my dog cough!""""No! I will not. I am allowed to have it! Mind your own business!"" he says with a wry smile.The woman angrily grabs the cigar and throws it out of the bus window. Then the man angrily stands up, grabs the dog and throws it out of the window.A few minutes of yelling and insults and the bus driver stops to handle the commotion. He orders them both off of the bus. Standing on the side of the road they notice something running towards them. It was the dog! And what do you think the dog had in it's mouth? The cigar?Nope. The fucking brick."

0	"Little Johnny overheard a couple of girls in school_____The kids were whispering ""Purple flowers, purple flowers,"" and giggling. Curious what this meant, Johnny asked his friend.""Jimmy, what does purple flowers mean?"" Johnny asked.Little Jimmy looked at Johnny in horror and said ""I'm not gonna be friends with someone who says stuff like that!"" and ran away from Johnny.Johnny next asked the teacher ""Teacher, what does purple flowers mean?"" The teacher looks at Johnny, mortified, and says, ""I won't have kids saying that kind of language in my class. Go to the principal!""Johnny heads to the principal's office and asked, ""Miss, what does purple flowers mean?"" The principal replies with, ""You are expelled, I won't have any students in my school speaking that kind of language!""Johnny head to the bus stop, and once he gets on, he asks the bus driver, ""Mister, what does purple flowers mean?"" The bus driver pushes Johnny off the bus, and says, ""I won't have your cussing in my bus!""Johnny walks all the way home, and after he gets there, he tells his parents he got expelled. His parents ask why, promising not to get too angry, and to let him off with a warning. ""Well, I asked the teacher what purple flowers means."" Johnny's mother faints from her son's foul language, and in anger, the father says, ""Get out, no son of mine will say such terrible things!""Johnny heads to the homeless shelter, planning to ask the homeless people about you-know-what, but they were all passed out and drunk. He goes to the owner of the homeless shelter, who's standards were pretty low, and asked if he knew what purple flowers meant. The guy says no, but the old man who didn't give a shit about what people said might know. Then he tells Johnny to get the fuck out, because his language is a ""bad influence"" on the homeless people.Johnny goes to the old man, and knocks on his door. A short, grumpy guy with little hair and a lot of beard answers the door. Johnny says ""Excuse me sir, do you know what purple flowers means?"" The man says no, but the old lady who lives in a house faraway might know. Johnny, who's lost everything at this point, decides to go to this old lady's house, which was quite a distance away from the town he grew up in. Taking nothing but his wit and the clothes on his back, he started his journey. He crossed deserts with scorching heat and freezing nights, oceans teeming with hostile life, grassy plains and jungles full of Savage natives, going the route told to him by the old geezer. He had to prove that he was worthy to the savages by chopping off the genitals of an endangered species of pink panther in the Amazon. He crossed the vast Atlantic in a raft made from old Gatorade bottles he found on the beach. During his time at sea he was attacked by a rare blue footed booby, which was inexplicably in the middle of the Atlantic. He lost his foot to the monsterous boobies. He went to Egypt, where he killed a 100 year old vampire with the ability to stop time. He nourished himself with nothing but sand and spit. He grew into his teens, and then his 20's, until he finally reached West City (which was in the east of Egypt) to the lady's house, which was the southern area of northern Cario. The lady's house was just in front of him.Johnny, exhausted, limped across the road. He's so tired he doesn't notice the massive moving van coming directly at him. He has time to see the driver. It was Jimmy, his childhood friend, in a moving company's uniform. In his shirt pocket was a beautiful purple flower. It was the last sight Johnny would ever see. The blood that got smeared on the front of the van and in the road never went away.Well, I think we can all learn a very valuable lesson from Johnny's demise; that is, look both ways before crossing the road."

They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.(edit: obligatory editted thanks to the kind people who handed over silver & gold to my stupid joke)

Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

0	A store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City, where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:_____You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building! So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs. She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads: Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids. 'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.' So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking. 'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework. 'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads: Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak. She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.Naturally some bright spark opens A New Wives store. Floor 1 - Has wives that love sex. Floor 2 - Has wives that love sex, have money and like beer. The remaining floors have never been visited. It just goes to show that men are easier to please.

It was about a wealthy older man who offered $1 million to sleep with another man's wife. The older man in the movie was Robert Redford, a very famous and handsome man, so it was not really a tough choice to make. The joke starts off with a son asking his father ""what's the difference between theory and reality"". The father says, go ask your Mother if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his mother. She thinks about it for a few seconds and says, YES! of course I'd sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the boy goes back to his Father and says, ""Mom would would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". Then the Father tells his son to ask his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. So the son asks his sister if she would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million. She too thinks about it for a few seconds. ""Well he is old but he is still handsome and famous"". ""$1 million, is a lot of money"". ""Yes, I'd sleep with him for $1 million"". So the boy returns to his Father and says ""Yes, sis would sleep with Robert Redford for $1 million"". ""But what has this got to do with answering my initial question""? The Father replies ""Well son, in theory, we are millionaires"". ""But in reality, we are living with two whores"". "

The men worked right past the fellow with the soft drink and went on down the road. “I can’t stand this,” said the man tossing the can in a trash container and heading down the road toward the men.        “Hold it, hold it,” he said to the men. “Can you tell me what’s going on here with this digging?”        “Well, we work for the county government, ” one of the men said.        “But one of you is digging a hole and the other is filling it up. You’re not accomplishing anything. Aren’t you wasting the county’s money?”“You don’t understand, mister,” one of the men said, leaning on his shovel and wiping his brow. “Normally there’s three of us–me, Rodney and Mike. I dig the hole, Rodney sticks in the tree and Mike here puts the dirt back.” “Yea,” piped up Mike. “Now just because Rodney’s sick, that don’t mean we can’t work, does it?”

Bob springs into action; he flips his lights, pulls out, runs the truck down, and pulls him over.Bob walks up to the window and sees a Hispanic man in the drivers seat.“Sir, do you have any idea how fast you were going? Also where are you headed to?”“I believe I was doing close to double the speed limit officer. And I’m headed to see me family.” replies the Hispanic man.“License and registration please” says Bob.“I do not have them” the Hispanic man admits.At this point Bob comes to the conclusion that he is most likely dealing with an illegal immigrant. Albeit the holiday season, despite him not wanting to, Bob took an oath to uphold the law thus he is forced to call ICE. Upon arrival they immediately arrest the Hispanic man and he is deported the next day. Bob feels awful.The next year Bob is once again scheduled to work around the holiday season and is posted at his favorite roadway. Within the first hour a pickup truck flies past him doing easily double the speed limit! Bob immediately turns on his lights, pulls the vehicle over and approaches the drivers window. Much to his surprise it is the same Hispanic man from the year before!“Do you know why I pulled you over? Also where are you headed?” He asks.The Hispanic man calmly answers. “I believe I was doing double the allowed limit. I am headed to see me family”Bob is confused and a tad flustered at this point.“Sir haven’t we met before? Same time last year? Same circumstances? Have you gotten your citizenship straightened out yet?” “Yes we have met before. Same time last year under the same circumstances indeed. No I am still not a citizen yet” replies the Hispanic man.Bob sighs.He proceeds to call ICE authorities and once more the Hispanic man is arrested and deported the next day. Bob is puzzled.For the third year in a row Bob the policeman is scheduled to work around the holiday season. Per usual, he is sitting at his favorite roadway when his eyes behold an all too familiar sight. A pickup truck blows past him this time doing triple the allowed limit!Bob sounds his siren, chases the vehicle down, and pulls it over. He runs up to the window only to see the same exact Hispanic man from both years prior!Completely bewildered. “Sir this is the third year in a row around the same time of year, under the same circumstances! Surely by now you know I will be sitting here yet you still come through here speeding! If you would just do the speed limit you would be able to see your family in peace!” He exclaims.“Well, if I don’t drive fast enough then I’m afraid I won’t be able to see them as it is not practical for me to purchase a plane ticket.” The Hispanic man explains.“Sir, i am sorry but I must contact the authorities once again. I’m afraid you will be arrested and deported for the third year in a row. I hate to do this.” Bob says.“No, no, it’s quite alright really.” Replies the Hispanic man.Still very confused, Bob asks. “If you don’t mind my asking, where exactly is it that your family lives that you must drive so fast to get?”The Hispanic man, with the straightest of faces, looks Bob the policeman dead in his eyes, and smoothly answers. “Cuba.”

0	"Jay Leno Joke_____Two hunters are out and about in the bush when they suddenly approach a hole in the ground. The hole is pitch-black dark and they debate between themselves, how deep it might be? Quickly, one of them takes out a used bullet shell from his pocket and throws it into the hole. Nothing, they fail to hear it drop. The other hunter notices there's an anvil just by the hole and directs the other to help him lift and throw it into the hole. After considerable effort and at great expense of their backs, they manage to throw the anvil into the hole, but again are disappointed to not hear it hit the bottom. They stand over the hole, with their hands on their knees, squatting over to try and see if there's a bottom. Behind them there's a noise, some sound of trampling leaves and breaking branches in the bush. One hunter quickly grabs the other as a goat seemingly out of nowhere darts between them and straight into the hole. The hunters totally confused decide that it's time to get out of there and call it a day. As they head over to their truck parked on the side of a long narrow road there comes a farmer yelling Becky?? Becky?? and approaches the hunters to ask: ""hey have either of you seen a goat roaming around"". One of the hunters replies: ""Yes, in fact we saw it jump into this hole and points in the direction of the bush where they just came from"". The farmer replies: ""that's impossible, I had her tied an anvil"". \>>>>I heard this joke told by Jay Leno on a podcast deconstructing what makes for an effective joke<<<<&#x200B;"

Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'"

0	found while browsing Quora_____Donald Trump, Theresa May, and Angela Merkel are walking outside after a particularly stressful diplomatic meeting.As they walk in silence, one of them stumbles on a small rock - but when they investigate, they find it is not a rock at all, but an antique oil lamp.“Maybe there's a genie,” says Donald. The women seem skeptical, but the three of them pry the lamp from the ground, and together, they rub it.Sure enough, a genie pops out. The mystical creature floats above them, sweet smelling smoke hanging around him as he smiles down upon the three world leaders.“You have summoned me,” the genie says. “You may have one wish each.”The Donald does not hesitate. “The American people voted for me to build a wall,” he says, “So, I want you to build a big, beautiful wall around the USA.”The genie claps his hand, and a mighty thunderclap sounds. “It is done,” he booms.Theresa May thinks, then says, “The British people voted for Brexit, so we could have control of our borders,” she says. “I'd like a strong and stable wall around the UK.”Another clap. “It is done.”Now, Merkel looks thoughtful. “Before I make my wish - can I ask, what are the walls like?”The genie says, “Each wall is 500 feet tall. They are 50 feet wide. The foundations go down another 200 feet. And nothing can get in or out.”“Excellent,” Merkel says, a rare grin crossing her face. “Fill them both with water.”

He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn't sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk."" Distraught, the man is forced to leave.Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.The monks reply, ""We can't tell you. You're not a monk.""The man sa,ys, ""If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""The monks reply, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""The man sets about his task. After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""The monks reply, ""Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""The sound is beyond that door.""The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, ""This is the last key to the last door.""The man is apprehensive to no end. His life's wish is behind that door!With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......But, of course, I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk. "

Knowing that one of the teachers at their school was from the UK and maybe had an angel on top of the tree instead of the classic star, they went to ask him about it.It's a long story he said: It began a very, very long time ago. It was a cold and snowy day, as it usually is on the North Pole. December was almost halfway passed already, but still, no decoration were in place. The elves couldn't make time to decorate as they were busy making toys. And Father Christmas was in a very, very bad mood. So the Christmas angel figured he had to do something to cheer him up so Christmas would be joyful as always. Thus, he cleaned the workshop and the house, tossed out the old take away leftovers and went to look for the decorations. Approaching Father Christmas he asked:\-What should I do with these decorations? The angel asked.\-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed back.The angel figured he put up the decorations and give Father Christmas another day. Maybe the clean house and the decorations would cheer him up. And the next day the angel went to Father Christmas to ask about how he should organize the Christmas gifts on the sleigh. \-I don't care, leave me alone! Father Christmas hissed again. The angel, not admitting defeat just yet. He let another day pass and figured he should put up the Christmas tree while he were on it. Not entirely sure where to put it, as it never was in the same spot for two years in a row, he meekly approached Father Christmas, hoping he would be in a better mood as Christmas was very, very close.\-Where do you want the Tree? The angel asked.\-As far as I'm concerned ..., said Father Christmas. You can take the tree and SHOVE IT UP YOUR...\-And that's the story of how the Christmas angel got on top of the Christmas tree.

Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. The butcher follows, dumbstruck. As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell, then the butcher follows him off. The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door. He does this again and again. No answer. So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.

1	Three years ago I mistakenly bought my son a giant conch shell…_____I have a son who’s on the spectrum. It’s quite common for people like him to latch onto one specific topic and become an absolute encyclopedia about it. Some people choose trains, some a cartoon. For my son, this was mollusks. Interesting topic I know, but it seemed to be a pretty good deal for us because it meant he’d get really excited about going outside to the beach which we figured was healthier than staying inside all the time. He’d always have a shell with him, or in his pocket. Usually he doesn’t want to talk much, but if you opened the conversation to it, he’d sit there rattling off facts about mollusks for hours.  This was shaping up to be a long term passion, so for his 15th birthday I went out and bought him a giant conch shell. He absolutely loved it. The texture, holding it to his ear etc. It was too big to carry around with him all the time, but he kept it by his bed.  Fast forward three years, this is where things get weird. About a month ago I was cleaning his room and picked up the conch to dust it off, something I’ve never actually done before. I was immediately hit by a terrible smell – I don’t want to get too into the gross details but I’m a dude, a once 18 year old dude, so I know what happens when you use something to masturbate and don’t clean it. I’m sure we all know what that smells like even after a week. It was pretty clear he had been using this shell as a kind of Strombidae fleshlight for a long, long time without cleaning it.  I’m not going to share too much about what happened when this all came to light, but we tried taking it away and my god you’d think we just took his whole world. We decided to give the shell back, but worried this reflected a deeper issue my partner and I decided to get some professional help.  So it’s been about a month of him seeing a behavioural therapist, and she recently asked me about his progress at home. I told her it’s been incredibly promising so far. He’s really starting to come out of his shell.

This pigeon was flying over and spotted her, so the pigeon flew down and asked what was wrong._____The little girl told the pigeon that she wanted to be a ballet dancer more than anything, but the only way she could be a ballet dancer was to get to France, being really the only place that teaches ballet.After thinking for a moment, the pigeon told the little girl to wait and he would return.About an hour went by, then the kindly pigeon returned with 30 of his mates, they all had ropes hanging out of their beaks, and on the end of the ropes was a raft.The pigeon told the little girl to jump on the raft, and they would take her across to France. About half way across the Channel, a storm blew up and the ropes broke. Despite the pigeons' best efforts, the raft sank, and sadly- the little girl drowned.The moral of this story is:  you can’t be a ballet dancer if you're pigeon towed.

0	Doh!!!_____A man and woman had been married for more than 60 years. They had shared everything. They had talked about everything. They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about.For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover.In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000.He asked her about the contents.'When we were to be married,' she said, ' my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.'The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two Times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with Happiness.'Honey,' he said, 'that explains the doll, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?''Oh,' she said, 'that's the money I made from selling the dolls.'

The wizard closes his eyes breathing in deeply, holding his breath, then releasing.*Click clack click clack click*The bones scatter across the table and the wizard begins to decipher the man's fortune.

Intrigued, the man asks how it works. ""Well, you put $100 in and then you'll win the whole jar if you complete three tasks.""The jar is quite large and full to the brim with what must be thousands of $100 bills. Excited, he asks, ""What are the three tasks?""The bartender says, ""Well, first you have to drink three straight pints of whiskey without throwing up. That's three entire pints, mind you. Most people can't do it."" ""Okay,"" the man says, clearly seeing that this is dangerous but doable, ""what's the second task?""""Through this door, I have a pet alligator, and he has a sore tooth. It's been bothering him for ages. You need to pull his tooth for me.""""Holy shit,"" the man says, ""alright, well, what's the third task?""""My granny lives upstairs, so I can take care of her. She's lonely and hasn't gotten laid in over 30 years. Go upstairs and make her feel young again.""The man thinks very hard about these tasks, then nods his head, takes out a fresh, crisp $100 bill and stuffs it into the jar. The bartender pours the three pints of whiskey, which the man promptly starts drinking. It takes him a minute or so, and he nearly vomits, but manages to keep them down. He then goes through the doorway, stumbling slightly, to the alligator room. An immense howling is soon heard, grunting, scratching, and some of most painful and excruciating sounds the bartender has ever heard. After a few minutes, the man stumbles back through the doorway, looking a little worse for the wear, and says, ""Alright... So, where's that old lady with the sore tooth?"""

As they are hiking through the forest, they come across two large black bears.  The guide tells him to be quiet and not move and the bears should be on their way.  Moshe ignores this advice, grabs his camera as as he's about to take a picture, one of the bears grabs the tour guide and eats him whole.  Moshe hightails it out of there and after what seemed to be hours of running, he comes across the forest ranger.  He tells the ranger the story and the ranger asks Moshe to lead him to the spot.  After a long walk, they come to the clearing and both bears are still there, but there is no sign of the tour guide.  The ranger asks Moshe which bear the guide is in as he needs to euthanize the right bear as it would be dangerous for tours.  Moshe points to the male bear and said, it was definitely that one.  The ranger pulls out his rifle, shoots the bear and the female one scurries off in fear.  He pulls out his knife, cuts the bear open and nothing.  Moral of the story: Never trust a Jew when he tells you that the Czech is in the Male

0	Politician dies...._____ While walking down the street one day a Member of Parliament is tragically hit by a truck and dies.   His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.   'Welcome to heaven,' says St. Peter.          'Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. We  seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.'   'No problem, just let me in,' says the man.   'Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher  up.  What  we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven.  Then   you can choose where to spend eternity.'   'Really, I've made up my mind.  I want to be in heaven,' says the MP.   'I'm sorry, but we have our rules.'   And with  that, St. Peter escorts him to the  elevator and he went down, down, down  to hell.  The  doors open and he found himself in the middle of a green golf course.  In  the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other  politicians who had worked with him.   Everyone is very happy and dressed in evening dress. They  run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the  people.   They played a friendly game of golf and then dined on lobster, caviar and champagne   Also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly & nice guy  who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are having such a  good time that before he realizes it's time to go.   Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and wave whilst the elevator rises....   The elevator rises and the door opens in heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.   'Now it's time to visit heaven.24  hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from  cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing.  They have a good time  and, before he realizes it, the 24  hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.'Well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. now choose your eternity.'   The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers: 'Well, I would never have  said it  before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would  be better off in hell.'   So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down,down  to hell.   When the doors open he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.   He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.   The devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder. ' I don't understand,' stammers the  MP.      'Yesterday  I was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate  lobster and caviar, drank champagne, danced and had a great time. Now  there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.   What happened?    The devil looks at him, smiles and says,'Yesterday we were campaigning -    Today you voted’.

0	A girl was going to study for her AP exams... [long]_____A girl was starting to study for her AP exams, and her parents bought her a new calculator to help her out.  The next day, she took the calculator in to class and started using it. The moment she started hitting the keys, she heard a guitar playing country music. Startled, she stopped and put it back in her bag. During a break, she investigated further. She keyed in 2+2 and the guitar started again.  That’s odd, she thought, but I’m sure it’s nothing. It’s just a little annoying.She went on to do her homework with the device, but by the end of the day, she was so sick of it playing music that she decided to take it to a service shop. “Can I help you?” asked the employee. “My parents gave this to me yesterday. It’s brand new, but I think there’s something wrong with it,” she said as she handed the calculator over. The employee pressed a few buttons and guitar began. When he stopped, the music stopped as well. “What’s the problem?” he asked. This took the girl by surprise. “Well, it’s the music.”“Okay,” replied the employee. This has to be a joke, she thought, and continued: “I started doing addition and subtraction and it started playing some country music.”“Okay,” he replied again. “And then I tried multiplication and division, and I know this sounds crazy, but a fiddle joined in.”“Right.”“By the time I got to my actual calculus work, I swear it was playing zydeco!”“Well, I don’t really see the problem then,” he said, handing it back. “It’s not going to sing for you. It’s a Texas Instrumental.”

0	Notes from an inexperienced Chili taster named Frank, who was visiting Texas from the East Coast:_____Recently I was honoured to be selected as an outstanding famous celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a Chili cook-off, because no one else wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last moment, and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking for directions to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and besides, they told me that I could have free beer during the tasting. So I accepted.Here are the scorecards from the event:CHILI # 1: MIKE'S MANIC MONSTER CHILIJUDGE ONE: A little to heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavour. Very mild.FRANK: Holy Shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried paint from your driveway with this stuff. I needed two beers to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. Those Texans are crazy.CHILI # 2: ARTHUR'S AFTERBURNER CHILIJUDGE ONE: Smokey, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavour. Needs more peppers to be taken seriously.FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave of two people who wanted to give me the Heimlich manoeuvre. They had to walkie-talkie in three extra beers when they saw the look on my face.CHILI # 3: FRED'S FAMOUS BURN DOWN THE BARN CHILIJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili. A bit salty. Good use of red peppers.FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. I'm getting shit-faced.CHILI # 4: BUBBA'S BLACK MAGICJUDGE ONE: Black Bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or other mild foods. Not much of a chili.FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. Sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb bitch is starting to look HOT, just like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.CHILI # 5: LINDA'S LEGAL LIP REMOVERJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. Very impressive.JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no linger focus my eyes. I farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. The contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly from a pitcher onto it. It really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. Freakin' Rednecks! ! !CHILI # 6: VERA'S VERY VEGETARIAN VARIETYJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice and peppers.JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions and garlic.FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulphuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!CHILI # 7: SUSAN'S SCREAMING SENSATION CHILIJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum. Tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I am worried about Judge # 3.FRANK: You could puta Grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't feel a thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of lava-like shit, to match my shirt. At least the during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. I'm not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck it in through the four inch hole in my stomach.CHILI # 8: HELEN'S MOUNT SAINT CHILIJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending. This is a nice blend chili, safe for all; not too bold, but spicy enough to declare its existence.JUDGE TWO: This final entry isa good balanced chili, neither mild now hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when Judge # 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.FRANK: - - - - - Mama?- - - (Editor's Note: Judge # 3 was unable to report).

So they wait out the spring, and they leave the dog in the  summer.The summer passed and at the first days of autumn they went to get their dog.Now the hunting season was open, they went up the woods with their dog, after couple of hours searching for animals they spotted a hole in the ground, they started shooting at it BANG! BANG!&#x200B;&#x200B; \- The dog started dancing around haply, thinking it was another wedding.

She tells me I need to get a topography test which couldn't be done at her office.  Instead, she sent me to the Eye Center at a local hospital.  While I was there, I asked if this was same building I would go when it came time for the actual procedure.  They confirmed that it was.The time for the surgery came, and I show up at the same wing of the hospital, which was rather large.  They apologized and said I was in the wrong building.  I actually needed to go across the street which was a main road but was still considered part of the hospital.  I asked the name of the building I was looking for, and they said it was the Urology building next to a Starbucks (go figure).  I asked, ""Are you sure?  I have to go to the Urology Center for eye surgery?""    Apparently, the Urology Center was the only building with rooms large enough to house the machine they used to perform the surgery.Everything went well once I found the building, and my eyes turned out fine.  After relaying this story to my dad a few days later, he said, ""Well, it's a good thing you didn't end up cock-eyed."""

She directs him to the interviewer's office.The interviewer says, ""Now, before we go over your qualifications, I want to give you a quick tour of the premises."" He leads him to a room and says, ""This is the harvesting room."" The man peers in and sees thousands of gold colored statues of all different sizes. Many workers are disassembling them with hammers, chisels, and Dremels and then separating the pieces into two giant bins.The man is confused, but holds his tongue. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Seeking Center'.  Inside, workers are busy talking on the phone and browsing online auctions. The interviewer says, ""This is where we find and purchase the statues. We use Ebay, Amazon, thrift stores, antique shops, and any other means we can to find and buy statues at competitive prices."" The man is a little confused, but only nods and smiles. The interviewer then leads him to 'The Packaging Room'. Inside, workers are packaging scrotums of all different shapes and sizes that had been removed from the statues. The poor man is sweating, blushing, and frankly a little disgusted.The interviewer says, ""And those tubes over there lead straight to the shipping center and the gift shop! Alright, now let me see your resume."" The flustered man says, ""On second thought, maybe this job isn't for me. I have to go."" He rushes past the interviewer and walks briskly to the exit.

0	A traveler was walking along the side of the road hitchhiking on a dark night in the middle of a thunderstorm_____Time passed slowly and no cars went by. It was raining so hard he could barely see his hand in front of his face.Suddenly he saw a car approaching, moving slowly and appearing ghost-like in the rain. It slowly and silently crept toward him and stopped.Wanting a ride very badly, the guy jumped into the car and closed the door; only then did he realize that there was nobody behind the wheel, and no sound of the engine to be heard over the rain.Again the car crept slowly forward and guy was terrified, too scared to think of jumping out and running. The guy saw that the car was approaching a sharp curve and, still too scared to jump out, he started to pray and beg for his life. He was certain the ghost car would go off the road and into the river, and he would surely drown!But just before the curve, a shadowy figure appeared at the driver's window and a hand reached in and turned the steering wheel, guiding the car safely around the bend. Then, just as silently, the hand disappeared through the window and the hitchhiker was alone again.Paralyzed with fear, the guy watched the hand reappear every time they reached a curve. Finally the guy, frightened nearly to death, had all he could take and jumped out of the car and ran through the storm to the nearby town.Wet and in shock, he went into a lighted tavern and with voice quavering, ordered two shots of whiskey, and then, shaken, he told everybody about his supernatural experience.A silence came over those listening and everybody got goose bumps.They realized the guy was sober and was telling the truth. And the sounds of the storm continued outside.About a half hour later, two guys walked into the bar and one says to the other, 'Look Billy Bob, there's that idiot that rode in our car while we was pushing it in the rain.'&#x200B;

1	"Dave was bragging to his boss one day_____ ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.""President Trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.At the White House, Trump spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work.

He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out onto the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'"

When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked! I hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again."""

There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‘No, this is my first time.’So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty.‘Just a minute,’ she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‘Do these excite you?’ She asked.Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk.‘Well, come on’, she said, ‘We don’t have much time.’ So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments.She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‘Did you put that condom on?’ she asked.I said, ‘I sure did,’ and held up my thumb to show her.She fainted.”

0	"The Talking Cat._____A 2 bit magician had a show called ""Goldie, the Magic Talking Cat"".  He wasn't that skilled of a magician, so he had to make up for his lack of talent with cheesy 2 bit tricks.   He found this cat that looked like it was clearly abandoned.  It had fleas and ticks, wasn't fixed and it didn't have a collar.  So he adopted the cat, cleaned it up and got the cat fixed.   He gave him the name ""Goldie"" because of his golden orange  fur.  So he had an idea on how to make money from his new pet.   He was going to advertise his pet as ""a talking cat"" and take it to magic shows.  The cat loved to meow all the time, so he thought he could make his money off of the cat's meows.  The man showed off his talking cat at his show.   He had his tip jar ready.   After a few mundane magic tricks, the man pulled out the main attraction: The talking cat.   He then asked the cat ""Hey Goldie, what's the name of one of China's former leaders?""The cat said ""Mao""The crowd chuckled and thought it was cute. A few people tipped him.  But they still wanted to see the cat speak.  The man did a magic trick in front of the cat.  The disappearing kitty treat.  The cat then went ""Wow"".   ""See that?"" the man cried.  ""That cat said wow!""The crowd rolled their eyes.  He got a few coins in his tip jar for the trick itself.   The magician, sensing that the crowd would turn on him, got desperate.  ""Hey Goldie, where does milk come from""The cat then said ""Cow""The crowd walked off and groaned.As the crowd walked off, the cat said ""Some cultures drink goat and sheep's milk.  We just drink cow's milk in America due to cultural differences.  Also, I would say the Wu Sangui was a former Chinese leader, but few Westerners know of his existence.  And I didn't want to swear in front of the kids, so I said 'wow'  The tip jar is this way, folks.  Thanks for rescuing me, by the way, magic man!""He walked into his carrier and then took a nap.   "

He decided that they were going to be on a diet together to help them live for as long as possible.

It was tough for them all to stick to the plan at times, however they got through it together. They each lost between 120-140 pounds over the course of 20 years and were in amazing shape for their age.&#x200B;One day the 3 of them were given great news.Bert got a call, he answered it, then turned around to everyone and said: ""Guys!

I'm going to see so many people that I haven't seen in years!"".&#x200B;They found out that the wedding, hospital, and park where the reunion was were all in the same town, and decided to carpool together to get there. It had snowed a little the day before and the roads were a little icy. As they were getting onto the highway, their car slipped and ran into a semi-truck.

The angels says: ""Congratulations, you made it to heaven"". The angel decides to show them around the place and starts at a banquet. ""Here is a banquet for you three to enjoy, you've earned it"". Chester looks a little sad, and Earl notices and asks him, ""What's wrong?"". Chester finally speaks up, ""Okay, this is so nice of you to put together, but we're on a diet. I wouldn't want to overdo my calorie intake for the day"". The angle replies to them, ""No worries, you can have as much food as you like without worrying about it"". The guys are elated by that news, when the angel decides to show them another place.&#x200B;Next, the angel decides to show them a place where they can spend time having fun. He shows them to a massive building with games everywhere you look. There are at least 50 pool tables, 30 bowling alley lanes, people are playing poker, there are arcade games everywhere, and tons of people enjoying themselves. He tells them,""This is where you may spend much of your time, if you choose. Many people enjoy it here and you might find some new friends"". The guys really like this room, but Earl notices that Chester is looking sad again. Earls asks him,""What's wrong?"". Chester responds with,""My wife left me because of my gambling problems, I don't want to disappoint anyone else because of it. I'm afraid I wont be able to enjoy this area"". The angel then slightly irritated lets him know,""Don't you see? There are no problems here. You don't have to worry about gambling issues, because money isn't an issue here"". Chester is especially happy to hear that news, and the angel decides to show them where they are going to live.&#x200B;The angel finally takes them to the third place, and it is a huge mansion. The guys are led inside, when the angel says, ""This is where you three can live, if you choose to. Otherwise we have some other mansions, if you want to live alone"". The guys are very intrigued by the house, they notice a big window on a wall with an amazing view. They could see for at least 5 miles clearly. They all can't help but gasp when looking through the window. Earl can't help but be concerned about this place. He decides to ask, ""So, uh... What's the rent here?"". The angel looks back at them with an irritated glare are replies ""Nothing? It's free"". Earl is sure to thank the angel and says,""Wow! That's so kind of you guys!"". Bert notices that Chester is looking a little sad. Bert says,""What's wrong Chester? Isn't it amazing here?"". Chester looks up, looks Bert in the eye and says a little mad, ""If it weren't for your goddamn diet. Bert. We could've been here 20 years ago!"".&#x200B;"

This was difficult because no one he knew played the bass, but one of chicken friends, pig, played the bass so chicken asked his friend if he wanted to join. Pig said sure so pig came to the farm to meet the rest of the bandThey played a couple of gigs and got really good over the period of 6 months, so good in fact they were asked by a famous television talk show host if they wanted to come in and perform for the show. The band gladly agreed and got ready to go. The host was a couple of states away so they had to take a plane, and so the day came and they went on the plane early.

Horse got off of the plane to find people in terror looking at the broadcasted news show in the airport he landed in, so watching the tv he saw that the flight his friends were on had crashed and there were no survivors. The horse a day later was really depressed so he went to a bar to drink his problems away. When he walked in he sat at the counter and the bartender took a look at him, seeing he was sad. Out of curiosity and wanting to see if he could help, the bartender approached the horse and asked, “Why the long face?”

0	There was once a 10 year old little boy_____Riding his blue bicycle in his mountain town. He hears a strange, unfamiliar bell coming from the top of the nearby mountain. He decides to investigate the next day. He wakes up extra early at 7am and begins his summit to find the bell. He arrives at the top of the mountain after a long 12 hour bike ride. There is a large monastery, where the sound has originated. He knocks on the door and a monk answers. “Hello” said the boy. “Yes?” Replies the monk.“I heard a bell coming from here yesterday, I’d like to know what it was.” Asked the boy. The monk replied, “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk.”The boy made the long ride back down the mountain and forgot about the bell. 6 years later on his 16 birthday, he bought his first car. The same day, he heard the strange bell again, and decided to investigate again, maybe he’d have better luck this time. He took his car and drove 2 hours up the mountain to the monastery. The same monk opened the door, and they had the same interaction as before, “what’s the sound” “I’m sorry, I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk”. So again the boy departed home. 15 years later, the boy is now a man, married, with 3 beautiful children and a red sports car. He hears the bell one day after work, and speeds up the mountain, this time he’s there in an hour and fifteen minutes. He arrives at the monastery and has the same interaction as the two previous times. So finally he says “I want to be a monk, to find out what that noise is”. The monk said, “First, you must sell your car, divorce your wife, abandon your kids and all your possessions, when you’re done, we can begin”. The man does what he’s told and comes back a month later. The monk is pleased to see him. “Take off your clothes, put on these robes and shave your head” the man complies. “Am I a monk now? “No, now read this encyclopedia and memorize everything, then you’ll be closer to being a monk”. The man memorized every word in the book and informs the other monk. It has taken him 4 years. “Am I a monk now?” The man pleaded, “no, Now I want you to find the needle in the hayfield out in the courtyard, then cut each blade of grass with scissors. This task takes the man 10 years. “Am I a monk ?” “Yes, you’re a monk” “what is the bell” the monk points to a door down the corridor. The new monk opens the door to see another, slightly smaller door. Then another. And another, until he’s only able to reach his arms through to open them. And finally he learns what the sound was, do you want to know what it is?I’m sorry I can’t tell you, you’re not a monk

0	The Cheerio_____In a land far away a cheerio named John had no life. Cheerios had three social classes, Normal cheerios, honey nut cheerios and frosted cheerios. John was a normal cheerio, no money, no life, nothing. So one day he decided he was going to change that. John got up and decided to get a job at McDonalds. He worked his ass off everyday and he eventually got promoted to the manager of that McDonalds. John woke up the next day, looked in the mirror and realized he was a honey nut cheerio. Even though he became a honey nut cheerio, he wanted more. He kept working hard until he became the CEO of McDonalds. He woke up the next day and looked in the mirror, and he was a glazed cheerio. Glazed cheerios need to have a certain amount of sugar intake to maintain their beautiful glazed outside so John got right to that. The next day, John invited to a glazed cheerio only party that was meant for the biggest glazed cheerios in all the land. When he got there and was partying, he realized that he hadn't consumed enough sugar. Becoming a honey nut cheerio right there would be so embarrassing. So he ran to the cake and there was a huge line. He ran to the soda there was a smaller line, but still to long. Finally we went to the punch, and you know what, there is no punch line.(i'm not sorry)

Just you go ahead and finish your meal, Sonny!'For lunch the old man made hamburgers. Again, John was concerned about the plates, as his appeared to have tiny specks around the edge that looked like dried egg and asked, 'Are you sure these plates are clean?'Without looking up the old man said, 'I told you before, Sonny, those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them. Now don't you fret, I don't want to hear another word about it!'Later that afternoon, John was on his way to a nearby town and as he was leaving, his grandfather's dog started to growl, and wouldn't let him pass.John yelled and said, 'Grandfather, your dog won't let me get to my car'. Without diverting his attention from the football game he was watching on TV, the old man shouted!'Coldwater, go lay down now, yah hear me!'

He was known for having incredibly convoluted heists, that often involved very expensive equipment. Perhaps one of the most notorious bank robbers from the wild west. After years of evading the authorities, and making ridiculous amounts of money, he finally makes his most explosive and expensive heist yet.”“Oh really? What did he do?”“Well, he bought hundreds of pounds of dynamite, and transported it all using hundreds of grunts-for-hire to help him carry it all the way to the bank. For this heist, he was gonna hit the biggest, most reinforced vault, of all of the south. All in one night, he managed to set all of the dynamite, and he set off the dynamite, but guess what happened?”“What happened?”“He blew up the whole place! There was nothing left of the vault or money!”“No way, that has to be the most expensive bank heist I’ve ever heard of!”“Yeah, he really broke the bank with that stunt”God this joke is awful. My tired, high ass thought of this last night and I thought it was the funniest shit ever.

His days continue as before, and his evenings are still spent in pleasant company, but a new addition to his routine is a nightly visit to the barrel.Another two months pass in this way and all is well, until one night as he gets up from his seat at the card table and announces that he is going to visit the barrel to his mates.A few chuckles greet this announcement and one of his friends asks ""Trying to get the final fun out of it eh?""""Final fun?

He heard that his neighbor down the road had a few fine chickens for sale so he decided to walk over to see if he could strike a deal.The farmer arrives at his neighbors place and after some haggling gets a great deal on a new pullet and cock.  While he is there he sees an old ass for sale and he asks the neighbor if he thinks that he could use it to haul things back on the farm.  The neighbor replied that he is a good worker but occasionally he will stop and you have to scratch his belly to get him moving again.  He again gets a good deal and marches off triumphantly with his pullet under one arm, cock under the other, and the reigns of his new ass in his hand.  The farmer gets about halfway back to his farm when the ass stops moving.  He cant scratch its belly since he would have to set down a chicken and risk it running off.  Unsure what to do he sees a carriage coming down the road which he promptly beckons.  A woman exits the carriage asking if he needs assistance to which he replies, ""could you hold my cock and pullet while I scratch my ass?"""

What could I do? I had no choice but to accept.I taught her everything: how to hold the bow, the correct way to pull the arrow, how to aim and everything. She was a quick learner.A few weeks in, she could hit the stationary targets surprisingly well, so I decided to step it up a notch earlier than expected:""We're going to move on to moving targets. Now, the key thing to remember with moving targets is that as soon as you see the target in your aim, you have to shoot immediately. Don't contemplate, don't even think about it - as soon as you see it, you shoot!""She was a natural! After just a couple of hours she could hit them just as well as - no, *better"" than the stationary targets! She was outstanding. I found myself starting to fall in love with her.The next week, I took her to the woods where to have her practice on wild animals as living targets. Just as expected, she picked it up almost instantly. It seemed like every single shot she took always hit her target. Honestly, at this point I think she ever surpassed my abilities! At this point, there was no doubt in my mind. I was madly in love with her!That night I asked her out on a date. She said to me:""If you had asked me that when I first met you, I would say yes in a heartbeat! But after all this time, after all you've taught me... I can't see you as anything more, or anything less than my teacher. I'm sorry... I guess you should have shot your target as soon as you saw it, huh?""And that's when I realized... I've trained that miss."

Now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.&#x200B;Sarah's favourite rooster, old Butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.&#x200B;To Sarah's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring.  He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one.&#x200B;Sarah was so proud of old Butch, she entered him in a Show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.&#x200B;The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No Bell Peace Prize"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well. &#x200B;Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making.&#x200B;Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the unsuspecting populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention?&#x200B;Vote carefully in the next election.

0	The Challenge [NSFW]_____A man walks into a bar, reaching the counter a sign hangs above the bar stating, “Complete The Challenge and Win Free Alcohol for Life!” Intrigued by this the man asks the bartender what exactly is the challenge. “Well first off you have to drink a gallon of apple cider vinegar, second we keep a gator in the back with a sore tooth, you gotta remove it, finally upstairs is a woman who’s never had an orgasm, she’s got to have one and once you accomplish that you win the challenge.” The Bartender states. The Man looks at him with disbelief at the absurdity of that, “I think I’ll pass” he says and goes on to order a beer.The night goes on and the Man starts to get a little tipsy, every beer he downs The Challenge seemed more and more tempting, until finally he walks back up to the counter, “Where’s the vinegar?” He says drunkenly. The bartender grabs the vinegar from under the counter and presents it to the man, being a little bit drinker he takes it and downs it like it was nothing. The Bartender and the patrons look at him astonished that they may have a worthy contender for the Challenge. The Man moves on and heads out the door to the gator, the next couple of minutes were horrifying hearing the gator rash around from the other side of the wall, until finally silence. The Man walks back into the bar covered in blood and scars, his clothes in shreds, he then asks the bartender, very drunkenly, “where’s that lady with the sore tooth?”.

He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500."""

(an original joke)_____The scariest and most feared whale in the entire ocean had his son kidnapped by krill, in a guerilla act of revenge for all of the family they'd lost over the years. They snuck up one night, and in their masses, surrounded the sleeping calf, and swam away, carrying him miles away from his father. Safe to say, when the whale awoke, he was distraught. He swam and swam, searching everywhere, but to no avail. 'WHERE IS MY SON' he bellowed, disturbing fish everywhere. This distress caught the attention of a wise old sea turtle. 'I saw your son', said the turtle swimming over to the whale, 'he was kidnapped by krill. I think I can take you to him'Grateful, the whale accepted this offer, and the pair set out, searching hastily. After many hours of fruitless looking, they came to a large white cloud, and they came to a stop. The turtle looked sombre. 'I have bad news', he said mournfully. 'The krill have used their surprisingly adequate war skills once again. They have lactated so much, that they have created this giant, impenetrable white cloud. It's so wide, so high, so thick. I'm so sorry, but it's over.'The whale would not accept this. 'I'll swim through it! He said''No', returned the turtle. The milk is bizarrely poisonous for whales. 'Okay then, we'll wait for it to disperse, then we can go after them again!', the wale countered'It will take days!' cried the turtle. The cloud is miles wide, and miles thick. There's no hope.'Alright then, can't I go over it, can't I even look over it?', the whale nearly sobbed in desperation.The turtle looked him dead in the eye. 'You don't understand. There's no use spying over krill milk'
0	Lil Johnny & the Bet_____Lil Johnny’s teacher had been warned never to make a bet with him unless she was absolutely sure she would win. One day Lil John came up to her and bet $50 that he could guess the color of her panties. The teacher thought for a moment and then said, “sure, come see me after class and we will find out.” The teacher is pretty sure she can win, but just to be safe she went to the bathroom and took off her panties out from under her skirt then went back to class. After class Lil John went up to her and she told him he could guess now. Lil Johnny thought for a few seconds then guessed blue. The teacher smiled and said no. Lil John asked her to prove it, the teacher lifted up her skirt to prove that she was not wearing panties. Lil Johnny said, “okay you won fair and square, come out to my dad’s car he will have your $50.” When they got out to the teacher explained that his son had made a bet with her that he could guess the color of her panties and lost and that she proved it by showing him that she had none on. The dad said, “that little shit, he bet me $100 this morning that he would see his teacher without clothes on by the end of the day.”

0	"A spy, an artist, and a basketball player are chewing the fat on the beach_____It was a lovely day so the three friends got together to enjoy each other's company and engage in stimulating discussions about various topics. The spy was initially hesitant to rendezvous at the beach, as she preferred more secluded settings where she had a chance to blend in with the crowd. On the beach, this was not possible, as she possessed an unrivaled figure that would be sure to attract attention from horny onlookers. But the spy recognized the futility of her efforts to persuade her stubborn friends so she ultimately decided to dress as modestly as possible in hopes of deflecting unwelcome eyes. It didn't work. She was the only person within a five-mile radius who came overdressed for the occasion. The artist noticed that there were a group of teenagers playing volleyball nearby and went over to ask them if he could join. The basketball player was puzzled by his friend's initiative, as everyone considered the artist something of a recluse. Perhaps the sun worked in mysterious ways and inspired in the artist what little social sensibility he could muster. The spy didn't think much of the gesture and turned her attention to the basketball player. ""Why don't you go join them?"" She asked. ""After all, you're a professional athlete."" ""You know why"" responded the basketball player. ""I most certainly do not"" replied the spy. ""In that case, I'm not going to tell you."" The day was growing old and the three friends said their goodbyes before retreating to their abodes. The spy reclined on her love seat and had a glass of wine while putting on her favorite record. The artist sat in his attic and painted a scene inspired by the day's events on the beach. He would take intermittent breaks to meditate and reflect. By the time he was finished with his painting, it was so marvelous and captured the authentic feeling of his experience on the beach so accurately that it was almost too beautiful to bear. He was impressed by his ability to directly translate his complicated emotions to the canvas and vowed to never grow complacent or satisfied with his progress for fear of resigning himself to idleness. Across town, the basketball player reached her home. That's the joke, the basketball player is a woman. You don't have to like it."

0	"Professional gamer longs to impress girlfriend with his skills_____The gamer began by explaining that being THE BEST at any given video game is a tremendously difficult feat. While the disparity between the average gamer and the very best gamer is lost on the layperson, he assured her that the gap was incredibly vast. The average viewer lacks the capacity to perceive this difference in skill, and indeed, part of being so damn good at what you do is making it look easy and seamless. Honing your craft requires years of dedication, sacrifice, discipline, repetition, strategic ingenuity, clever thinking...in short, you practically have to live and breathe video games. The gamer explained how he had sacrificed multiple friendships in pursuit of this single-minded goal to be the best. He even personally designed practice routines and finger training exercises for whatever he struggled with on a particular day, whether it be reaction speed, accuracy of input sequences, precision of movement, etc. At night, he would dream of simulated scenarios that may occur in his games and appropriately respond to them, effectively practicing while sleeping. It was an all-consuming path and his brain was an engine that kept running.He claimed that he used to think he was great at video games because he was the best in his neighborhood, and then the best in his circle of friends, but that with the advent of the internet and online games, he quickly realized that his skills were far from the best. He began to study the play of the REAL best gamers who time and time again would prove their mettle on the world stage, bringing home championship after championship. He wasn't delusional enough to continue thinking he was the best, but he was convinced that with enough practice, that could be him one day.At this point the girl was rather impressed. ""That's so funny, I never thought of it that way, but I guess you're right. It's just like being good at anything else really. It takes a lot of practice, smart thinking, fast fingers... I've watched a little League of Legends and I think it was called... CS Gold?"" ""CS GO"" he corrected her. ""Come on over to my house and I'll show you what it takes to be great.""So she followed him to his house, in part excited to see just how good her boyfriend was, but mostly just happy to support him for something he was passionate about. They arrived at his room. He turned on his Xbox. The girl laughed hysterically and left, never to be heard from again. The girl's name? pcmasterrace"

""I was in my truck mining my own business crusing down the interstate. I am coming to an overpass and I see cars dodging and swerving, then I see the problem. A punk teen has a brick tied to a rope and is swinging the brick at the cars. It was too late for me to get out of the way, the truck is much taller than a car. The brick smashed through the windshield and the rope got caught in the steering wheel.""""No way!"" Says the bartender.""That's not the half of it "" says Bob as he takes another swig of beer. The moron kid had wrapped the rope around his arm. With the rope caught in the steering wheel, it pulled his arm right off!By now, half the bar was around Bob listening to his story, ""but why did you go to prison!

The next morning he comes out an finds that a bird has built a nest in the mane of the mule. The farmer rips the nest out and goes out to plow. The bird is upset and dive bombs the farmer and the mule all day. The farmer only gets half the plowing done that day. Next morning, the nest is back. Again the farmer rips out the nest. And again the bird harassed the farmer all day. Once again he only gets half of the plowing done. Perplexed he goes to see  his grandfather and explains what is going on. His grandfather tells him that the same thing happened to him back in the day and that he solved the problem by rubbing soft cake yeast (not that powdered stuff) into the mule’s mane at night. Works like a charm says the old man. Desperate, the farmer rubs cake yeast into the mule’s mane that night. Next morning, no nest and the farmer gets a full day’s plowing in. Intrigued, the farmer goes back to his grandfather and asks why this worked. The grandfather replied, “Everyone knows that.,,Yeast is yeast and nest is nest andnever the mane shall tweet!”

0	"the Ogre and the Trids_____Once upon a time long, long ago there were beings called Trids barely making a living on the side of a hill. They knew, however, that there was a beautiful field of valuable Flurd just on the other side of the hill, and if they could get their hands on some of that Flurd, their lives would improve immeasurably.Unfortunately, there was a large, foul-tempered Ogre who lived on the top of the hill and guarded that Flurd night and day. The Trids tried everything to get over the hill to the fields of Flurd. They charged up the hill in great numbers. Didn't matter; the disgusting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted to sneak past the Ogre at night. Didn't matter; the despicable Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. They attempted a flanking maneuver; some Trids running to the left of the Ogre and others to the right. Didn't matter; the revolting Ogre kicked them all back down the hill. No matter what they tried, the damned Ogre kicked the Trids back down the hill. One day, as the Trids were moping around at the base of their hill, a small rabbit happened upon them. ""Why so sad, Trids?"" asked the rabbit. The Trids sadly told the rabbit about the beautiful Flurd on the other side of the hill, and how the terrible Ogre kicked them down the hill no matter how hard they tried to get to the other side.""How about I try?"" said the rabbit.""Go ahead,"" said the Trids miserably. ""But I don't think you'll have any luck.""So the rabbit hopped up the hill, approaching the Ogre. The Ogre ignored him. The rabbit hopped right alongside the Ogre. Still no reaction from the Ogre. The rabbit hopped right past the Ogre, and the Ogre did nothing!So the rabbit hopped down the hill, gathered as much Flurd as he could hold in his short rabbit arms, and hopped back up the hill. He then hopped right in front of the Ogre, holding the Flurd right in front of him.The Ogre opened one eye, sighed, and closed it again.""Excuse me, Mr. Ogre,"" said the rabbit, ""but how is it that you let me hop right past you and take as much Flurd as I can carry, but you kick the Trids down the hill whenever they get close to you?""And the Ogre said, ""Silly rabbit, kicks are for Trids.""&#x200B;"

0	"Macaroni and Beef_____This is not original, and not me, it is actually quite old (at least 1996) but I have not seen it here so here goes...&#x200B;Macaroni and Beef&#x200B;A couple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served.  Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards.&#x200B;It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment.&#x200B;We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you -- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into my belly. I was sated.  Perhaps a bit too much, however.&#x200B;I had not really been feeling well all day, what with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, I was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, I thought it was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern.&#x200B;Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress...&#x200B;Entering, I saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit, but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagonal wire cutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit. I went to the normal stall. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical proportions. I began ""The Move.""&#x200B;For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain ""The Move."" Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination rivaling that of a ballet dancer.&#x200B;I was about half-way into ""The Move"" when I looked down at the floor and saw a pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it when I had first walked into the stall. Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for a rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are a bit fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can.&#x200B;In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of ""30,000 Killed in Wake of Typhoon Fifi"" or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. &#x200B;But remember, I was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then I sat down. Recall that when that event occurred, I was already half-way to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on about one third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon. Now, back to the vomit...&#x200B;While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed. OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet.&#x200B;In the next several seconds, there were a handful of farts, a couple of turds, and the event ended, yet I was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit, my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three ceramic tiled walls to a height of about five feet, and still had enough force to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit. All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in a ring curiously in the shape of a toilet seat. And there was no fucking toilet paper.&#x200B;What could I do but laugh. I must have sounded like a complete maniac to the guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if I was OK since I was laughing so hard I must have sounded like I was crying hysterically. I calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened next. I simply told him that there was no way I was going to explain what was happening in the stall, but that I needed several wet towels and I needed him to go ask my wife to come help me. I told him where we were sitting and he left. At that point, I think he was probably assuming that I had pissed just a bit in my pants or something similarly benign.&#x200B;About two minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was wrong and with a certain amount of worry in her voice. I explained to her (still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight accident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close calls in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd or something and just needed to bring the car around so we could bolt immediately. Until I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt, and (by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies) new sneakers. And she then started to laugh herself since I was still laughing.&#x200B;She began to ask for an explanation as to what had happened when I promised her that I would tell her later, but that I just needed to handle damage control for the time being. She left.&#x200B;The manager then came back in with a half dozen wet towels and a few dry ones. I asked him to also bring a mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned. Without giving him specific details, I explained that what was going on in that stall that night was far in excess of what I would expect anyone to deal with, what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just slightly above.&#x200B;At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation. Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that I will be eternally grateful for his actions. He hooked up a hose. Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom. He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning myself up with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing the bag to my wife. I finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new clothes, still stuck in the stall since I figured that it would be in bad taste to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event I happened to be standing there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, I had only made a mess; I had not yet committed a felony and intended to keep it that way.&#x200B;When I finished getting dressed, I picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. I put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. I had intended to go to the manager and thank him for all he had done, but when I walked out, three of the management staff were there to greet me with a standing ovation. I started laughing so hard that I thought I was going to throw up again, but managed to scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front door. The upshot of all this is that I strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's Steak House. They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant in which I have eaten."

0	A rabbit walks into a butcher shop_____(All credit to Eddie Izzard, who told this joke at the end of his Wunderbar show here recently and who left us in stitches with his delivery of it.)&#x200B;One morning, a rabbit walks into a butcher shop and says, 'Hello, sir. Do you have any carrots?'The barber responds, 'Carrots? This is a butcher shop. We don't sell carrots here.''Oh', responds the rabbit, 'My apologies', and he hops out of the store.The next day, the rabbit comes back. 'Helloooo. Do you have any carrots?''You're that rabbit from yesterday, aren't you? I already told you. This is a butcher shop. We don't sell carrots.''Ahh. Right.' The rabbit hops out again.Day three comes around, and again the rabbit appears. 'Hiiiiiiiiiiiii. Do you have any carrots?''Look, mate, I've told you. This is a butcher shop. If you come back asking for more bleeding carrots, I'll nail your ears to the floor!''My ears, you say? Hmm, okay, thanks anyway.' The rabbit hops out.Day four passes, and there's no rabbit. Day five and day six pass without any sign of the rabbit, either.Day seven comes around, and suddenly, the rabbit reappears. 'Heeeeey. Do you have any nails?''....Nails? Of course I don't, you imbecile! This is a butcher shop!''Right. Got any carrots, then?'&#x200B;

0	She never said much._____I looked at her, on one cold autumn day in Georgia.Her hair was like fresh straw straight off a barn’s floor.Her eyes were like pearls gazing into the great beyond.Being the lucky man I was, I looked at those beautiful eyes, and talked to her everyday, and oft bring her flowers to make her feel good inside.And o, she’d look me right in the eye as I spoke.But she never said much.I knew she had a love for me though, and I could always return that love.I kept coming to her place for days upon days, and sometimes we even laid upon her bed together.But she never moaned when we had pleasure.She never said much at all.One day, the cops came and busted me for something I swear I didn’t do.But alas, I knew even 6 months away couldn’t keep us apart for long.And so time passed, day after day, week after week, month after month... until one day.Eventually, after all the paperwork was sorted out in court, I finally got out of court.But then I went back to court for an announcement I’d made plans for.I’d marry that girl.I loved her, and she loved me.Our parents supported us no matter what.And so the law twisted around me once again.And hence we both laid back on our earthen beds together once more, but this time for life.We were meant to be together; whether it meant serving time for fucking my sister’s corpse or not, because we were a happy family either way.

0	"lucky mailman_____after 20 years on the job the local postman is about to retire and on this last scheduled delivery run he finds himself beset with thankful friends and neighbours, all of whom show their appreciation of his years of service. loaded down with gift baskets, wine, flowers and thank you cards he reaches the last house on the run, owned by an incredibly buxom and attractive blonde, who was always friendly enough, and her very wealthy husband, whom the postman was sure never really liked him. as he pulls up he notices that the husbands car is already gone and this brightens the postman's mood a little as he knows he won't need to deal with the mans snide comments. ringing the doorbell and awaiting the wife's response the postman is nearly struck down with shock as the woman opens the door wearing nothing but a smile and, grabbing the postman by the tie, pulls him into the house, leads him up to her bedroom, and proceeds to fuck his brains out for the next half hour. still in a state of confusion but exceptionally pleased with how the last day of his carrier has gone, he is lead by the still naked woman to the kitchen where he is presented with a crisp, new $1 note and told to take a seat at the table. after a few minutes the woman, still displaying her ample assets serves the postman a full breakfast and asks what he'd like to drink, needing something to calm his nerves a little he asks for a scotch, one is poured and at last the woman puts on a dressing gown and sits down to breakfast with the postman. having finished off half the whisky he was poured the postman summons up enough courage to try and put his confusion to rest. trying very hard to keep his eyes on the wife's face and off her cleavage he says "" Ma'am please do not think I am in anyway ungrateful for what you have just done for me, this has been far and away the best retirement present I've received today but I have to ask, why? you're a married woman , and beyond that you are married to a man who really doesn't like me and would, I'm sure, be very upset at the level of err,... *hospitality*, you've just shown me. and after all I am a simple postman. what did I do deserve the pleasures you've just given me?"" The woman smiles sweetly and replies 'well when I found out you were retiring I felt we should do something special for you to mark the occasion,  I brought this idea up to my husband and asked what we should do to thank you, he said 'fuck the postman! give him a dollar' after a moments pause she adds 'the breakfast was my idea"""
0	"Once upon a time, there was a trainee fortune teller..._____Once upon a time, there was a trainee fortune teller called Sarah who hoped to learn the proper skills of divination by training alongside a renowned fortune teller, Madame Lointain (for, in these times, it was customary for each village to have a fortune teller).After having studied for many months and having completed all the necessary readings of varied tomes, Sarah was taught the most simple forms of fortune telling - reading the future from tea leaves in a cup, or the casting of chicken bones - but it wasn't until two years of studying that she finally graduated to the most renowned tool of all fortune tellers, the crystal ball.Madame Lointain explained the process to her. First an old sack cloth needed to be laid across the table, then the crystal ball was placed on the cloth. Finally the fortune teller should touch the crystal ball lightly with the very tip of their fingers and allow the divination to flow through them. When this process was complete, the crystal ball would cloud before showing the user a vision of the future.Sarah followed the steps and touched the crystal ball. There was a tingling sensation, the ball clouded, and she had the briefest of visions of herself as a fortune teller in her own village.""Congratulations!"" said Madame Lointain ""You have passed the final test of fortune telling - the test of scrying - which means you are no longer a trainee but instead are a fully qualified fortune teller!""Sarah was extremely pleased and immediately returned to her village, where she began preparing her house for her new business. She bought candles and incense, she bought a one-eyed cat and a toad, and she bought a set of good china, and the finest crystal ball she could find. Then she went to the market stall, where traders from Eastern lands sold their wares, and looked for a cloth to go beneath the crystal ball.Sarah decided that an old sack cloth would look very shabby beneath her beautiful new crystal ball and instead found herself taken by a beautiful purple fabric on one of the stalls.""What kind of fabric is this?"" she asked.""Why, you have an eye for quality,"" said the trader with a smile. ""For this is made from the finest milled silk. It is good enough for royalty in fact.""Well, that swayed Sarah completely and she purchased the fabric and completed the set up of her business. She was ready to open to the public, finally.To begin with, it was an immense success. She tossed chicken bones, she stirred tea leaves, but when she finally came to the climax of her display she found herself unable to see anything in the crystal ball. She strained, she pleaded inwardly, but it remained clear without a hint of cloudiness.Sarah made an excuse and gave her customer a refund, seeing them off with a smile, but was terribly worried. She was *sure* that she had done everything properly but it was no use, she was no longer able to scry. In floods of tears, she sent a message to Madame Lointain pleading for help and shut up shop while she waited.Three days later there was a knock at the door. Madame Lointain stepped inside and Sarah explained how she had lost the ability to successfully use the crystal ball.Firstly, Madame Lointain checked the crystal ball but it was in perfect working order. For a moment she was slightly bewildered as to what could be wrong, but then she noticed the purple fabric on the table beneath it. ""Where is the sack cloth?"" she asked.""Oh,"" said Sarah, ""I thought this was more beautiful. It is finest milled silk, good enough for royalty.""""Ah, well that explains it,"" said Madame Longtain with a sigh.""It does?"" asked Sarah.""Of course!"" said Madame Longtain, ""Haven't you ever heard it's no use scrying over milled silk?"""
0	There was once a priest who went to see the world after taking his oath._____After many years of wandering, he finally arrived in a small village in the middle of nowhere. The people there believed in the same religion as he did, but they had no church; they had to go to the nearest one which was in a small town 25 km's from there. The priest took the initiative, asked the Church for support, and with the help of the local men they built their own temple. From there on, he was celebrating the Sunday masses, joining together men and women in Holy Matrimony, and saying prayers at the funerals.Many years passed by like that.At the end of an ordinary mass, in early spring, on a chilly Sunday morning he was just guiding the people out of the church, was about to close the gates when an unknown man stepped into the churchyard.With his dirty and torn clothes, he stood before the priest and said:Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was a good man, and even though he thought the request was a bit strange, he went back to the rectory, took out a lemon, cut it in half, took it back to the man and gave it to him, who looked back to the priest with gratitude. However, the priest was curious. He asked:Son, why do you need this half of a lemon? - with a fright on his face, and before the priest could have said a thing, he rushed out of the churchyard gate and took off.A week later, around the same time, when the priest was leaving the church, he found himself in front of the same man in the churchyard. The man said:Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was surprised by the appearance of the man and his strange request. Of course he was good, went back to the rectory, and brought the half lemon. Placed it in the stranger's hand and immediately he asked:Here it is, my dear son, but please tell me why do you need this half a lemon? - the man was obviously frightened and immediately ran away but the priest was not sluggish either and ran after him. He wasn't in a very good condition, he has never run so much and so fast before so he was out of breath by the end of the village, almost fainted. He thought the strange man might appear again next week, and it would be nice if he could keep up with him, so he spent his week working on his cardio. It turned out to be a good idea, because as he thought, the stranger entered the churchyard on Sunday. The priest didn't even wait for the request, he was good, and brought the half lemon. He received these words from the man:Thank you priest for being so good and giving me half a lemon.Don't mention it son, -said the priest- but please tell me, what do you need it for?! - by the time he finished his sentence the man was already running, but the priest was close behind. They were running for a while and the priest was starting to feel exhausted when they arrived at a wide and swift river. The stranger without thinking threw himself into the river and swam across the river and disappeared on the other side. The priest didn't follow because he couldn't swim. He was annoyed when he got home. He spent the next week learning to swim at the swimming pool in the small town 25 km's away. He was anxiously waiting for the next Sunday; now he was sure that the weird fellow would visit again. On Sunday, as he was closing the church, the gate creaked, and entered the man:Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon! - the priest was good, went back, put on his swimming trunks, his running shoes, grabbed half of the lemon and took it to the stranger:Here it is, my son, but please tell me already, why do you need it? - the guy was terrified, rushed out the gate with the priest following. Reached the river, swam across, the priest right behind him. He kept running on the other side of the river and the priest was still on his tail. They kept running until they got to a tall tree on the verge of a deep ravine. The man climbed the tree with the agility of a cat, the priest not knowing how to climb a tree, stood on the ground. He was cursing everything as he walked back home. The following week the villagers watched as the priest in the garden of the church climbs trees, jumping back and forth, and generally behaving very strangely. The priest didn't care, he was exercising obsessively, preparing himself for the meeting. On Sunday before the mass, he put on his trunks and running shoes under his cassock. In fact, he was good and put half a lemon in his pocket in advance. The mass finished much earlier than usually, and he emptied the church as soon as possible so he could warm up. In the same exact time the mass should have ended, the strange man entered the churchyard.Priest, please be good... - the priest was already handing him half of a lemon, and asked:Son, why do you need it for God's sake? - the man ran away terrified, the priest followed him. They ran to the river, swam across, ran to the tree, climbed up. The priest almost catched the stranger when he grabbed a vine and swung to the other side of the ravine. The priest was about to have a stroke, but then he saw another vine. Whoop, he grabbed it and swung across. There, however, he encountered an unexpected obstacle: it was a plane graveyard and the man closed himself in one of the wreckages. The priest was raging as he walked around the wreckage several times, but he found no entrance except for the sealed door on the side of the plane; he had to open it somehow. He was furious but he went home. He spent every day at the village's locksmith and learned every possible way of opening a lock. On Sunday he held the mass in his swimming trunks, running shoes, on his back in a waterproof backpack was a crowbar, a cutting torch, a wrench and a drill, then he stood in front of the church and waited for the man. He was there on time.Priest, please be good and give me half a lemon!There you go, son - handing him the lemon, because he was good, but in the same time he grabbed the stranger's arm, pulled him close, and with obsession in his eyes, asked:But what do you need it for?! - panic came over the man as he made his escape from the priest's hands and ran away, but the priest was very close behind. Racing to the river they quickly got across, running up the tree almost breaking their necks, one after the other swung across the ravine, the man barely managed to close the door of the wreckege in the priest's face. Little did he know that the priest would not stop there, because he grabbed his backpack and started working on the lock with his tools. In less than an hour the heavy door creaked open. Inside, the stranger was shivering in horror, he was afraid of the priest's fierce and triumphant look. The priest slowly strode up to the man, crouched down, and very quietly, with a friendly smile on his face, gently asked:Son. You have been asking for half a lemon for the last few weeks. I'm very happy to give it to you, even in the future, I am only asking in return that you tell me: why do you need it?All right, priest ... - came the answer in a trembling tone - I will answer your question, but please, be good, and do not tell anyone.The priest was good, and never told anyone.

You will receive benefits such as:• Free college education • Many veteran benefits • Experience in many fields of work• Travel• Any free car after a special base trial The woman took the flyer home and gave it much thought. Although she was close to 40, if she joined the military she could finally afford to go to college, get a good job and make more money for her son and husband. Her family supports her and she after she enlists, the army makes some exceptions and she successfully joins.After undergoing training, traveling around a little, shes stationed at a base somewhere in afganistan. As shes doing her base work, she starts thinking about her family. Her son is going to be 16 soon and is going to get his lisence. Her husband works overtime every week to make mortgage and isnt home at all. They will need a second car if they're going to make everything work once she gets back. She heads over to her superior and asks about the ""free car"" she read about in flyer before she joined the army. She wanted to spend her last 6 months in the army trying to get this car. ""Oh yes! The army do these trials to improve efficiency on base and provides an incentive to do so. Because this is the first year, they've made it easy. Just guard every lookout station at least an hour per station every day until the trial is over."" It seemed easy enough but after a few days it proved rather difficult. She would wake up, do her exercises, guard one station, move to the next an hour later, do more exercises, guard another, do her base work, guard another, train, and guard another until she went back to sleep. She kept this up for her last 6 months in the army, spending any breaks she had going from lookout station to station until the trial and her service in the army was over. Her superior then held a meeting with her the day before she was headed home. ""I've never seen a soldier as determined as you during that trial! You deserve to ride around in any vehicle you want. When you get back, a certificate with be mailed to you. Just show the certificate to any car dealership you want and they will be obligated to give you any car for free""The woman thanked her superior and headed home. Once she landed, her husband and son were so happy to see her home. ""Honey I'm so glad you're finally home, we've been so eager to see you. We can start this new life we've been talking about"" said the husband.""Yeah Ma, I'm excited too! I've been wanting to surprise you. I applied to a bunch of colleges already and 3 already accepted me!"" said the son. ""Well I have a surprise for you guys too. If you're headed to college soon, you need something to ride around in! You ready? The army gave me a brand new car! Any car of my choosing in fact!"" The husband and son look at each other with confused faces and asked her what she was talking about. ""I told you before I joined the army about the car. There was this trial on the base I was stationed at. All I had to do every day for 6 months was go from one lookout post to the other until I covered all of them in one day. It was hard work, but it paid off""The husband and son still looked confused. ""Are you sure honey? I dont remember the 'any free car' thing. The military isnt some game show"" asked the husband.""No really! It was on the flyer I first showed you! What's so hard to believe?""""Well, think about it"" said the son. ""I find it hard to believe a bunch of re-posting would get you any free car, Ma"" "

1	Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community..._____If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each otherThe Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.The Rabbi pulled out an apple.With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'

So what's your story?""So the first man replies: ""Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this naked man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died right then and there on the balcony.""""That sounds like a pretty bad day to me,"" said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. ""It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and one of my favorite hobbies is dancing around naked while eating pickles out of a glass jar. As I was doing so the other day, I slipped on an errant pickle and slipped over the balcony. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but thankfully I fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right.  I thought I was the luckiest guy in the world, but a refrigerator fell out of the sky and crushed me to death!""Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. The man responds:""I died naked inside a refrigerator."""

For a month he just stared at it, studied it, drank it in. Then he spread his fingers and just moved his downturned palms left and right as if covering the ground on an imaginary piano keyboard. The prison guards laughed at and taunted him, but as time went on they were just quietly curious. Other inmates quizzed him and he said he had never played the piece before but it was his life goal and he didn't want to waste his 'enforced recreation time'.This went on for months and through the bars the guards could see his fingers flying while his eyes were either up and closed or open and aimed right at the score; his cellmates would even turn the pages for him, they'd got so used to his repeated movements. He just looked like he was not only playing the concerto, but absolutely smashing it, like when someone looks so comfortable it's effortless.Word got out via visitors and visitors' acquaintances and eventually to the local paper who sent someone to the prison. Eventually the buzz spread and the increased attention, regional TV news etc, really started feeding the guy's ego - a group of his ex musician contractors got together and organised a low-budget orchestra to play the concerto with him on his release, which got national media attention which led to a larger and larger orchestra and eventually the city's concert hall as venue, ticket proceeds for charity, all sold out on the day of his release, concert scheduled for that evening.I was sat in the stalls, three quarters of the way back, as he made his way to the stage.He was fucking awful, worst gig I've ever been to.

His dad said “ OK, so first think of me as the President, your mum as the Congress, the maid as the workforce and your baby brother as the future. Now see what happens and write that up.”So Johnny did this and felt hopeless as he had gotten nowhere, so he went to sleep. However, he had a nightmare and woke up. Deciding it might work, he tried his dad’s idea again. First he looked through the keyhole of the maid’s door and saw his dad cheating with her. In his parents’ room, his mother was fast asleep. Then he went into his brother’s room and saw he had done a No.2 in his nappy.He then finally came to his conclusion and said “Great. The president’s f***ing the workforce, the Congress is asleep and the future is full of s***!”

0	The Bee Joke_____Once, there was a bee who lived in a very complex bee hive. All the bees residing in this hive lived very happily with their own tasks and aspirations. However, this particular bee, named Bart, was quite special. He was an incredibly intelligent bee who matured and learned far faster than his bee peers. Even after his parents send him to bee high school at the age of 10, Bart the bee outperformed every one of his classmates. One day, his teacher invites his parents to class for a meeting. In this meeting, the teacher suggested that Bart be sent to a human high school. While at first skeptical, they decide that this would be the best opportunity for their son. They send Bart to a human high school, where surprisingly enough, he flourishes even more as a student. At the age of 16, Bart the bee graduated as a valedictorian at this human high school. When it came to furthering his education, he applied and was accepted to all the major ivy league universities across the country; Yale, Princeton, Harvard, you name it. He ultimately settled on MIT, where he studied as an honor roll student and became a Political Science major. After graduating at the age of 20, he used his knowledge to pursue politics, first running for the mayor of Boston, near MIT. Much to a shock of just about everyone, Bart the bee was elected almost unanimously, proceeding to become the most liked mayor of all time. Furthering his political career, he ran for the governor of Massachusetts, once again being unanimously elected with unprecedented approval levels. Bart the bee became the Governor of Massachusetts.To top it all off, Bart the bee decided that he would run for president of the United States. This, obviously, has never been attempted in the history of, well, ever. However, Bart had become so universally adored by nearly all of humanity, that there virtually no opposition to Bart's campaign. By default, Bart the bee became the POTUS. Having accomplished just about everything he could have possibly accomplished in his bee life, he looked back on his life and came to the realization that none of what he achieved would have been possible had his parents taken the leap of faith on his behalf. Thusly, he decided he would return to his home hive and spend some time with his parents.When Bart returned to the hive, he was welcomed as a celebrity, being loved by humans and bees alike. His parents were absolutely overjoyed to see their bee son once again. He decided that he would treat them to a delicious steak dinner at his favorite restaurant. After a bit of a flight, he arrives at the restaurant and finds that the wait time is over an hour long. Not wanting to abuse his status as president to obtain a table, he decides to take his parents to the pub for a drink. However, upon arriving at this pub, he realizes that the queue line is out the door and all the way down the block. Frustrated, he decides that he will simply take his parents for a nice glass of fruit punch. They fly down to the fruit punch stand down the street, and anyway there's no punchline.

0	"Walter took his wife Ethel to the state fair every year_____ And every time he would say to her, ""Ethel, you know that I'd love to go for a ride in that helicopter."" But Ethel would always reply, ""I know that Walter, but that helicopter ride is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""Finally, they went to the fair, and Walter said to Ethel, ""Ethel, you know I'm 87 years old now. If I don't ride that helicopter this year, I may never get another chance."" Once again Ethel replied, ""Walter, you know that helicopter is 50 dollars and 50 dollars is 50 dollars.""This time the helicopter pilot overheard the couple's conversation and said, ""Listen folks, I'll make a deal with you. I'll take both of you for a ride; if you can both stay quiet for the entire ride and not say a word I won't charge you! But if you say just one word, it's 50 dollars.""Walter and Ethel agreed and up they went in the helicopter. The pilot performed all kinds of fancy moves and tricks, but not a word was said by either Walter or Ethel. The pilot did his death-defying tricks over and over again, but still there wasn't so much as one word said. When they finally landed, the pilot turned to Walter and said, ""Wow! I've got to hand it to you. I did everything I could to get you to scream or shout out, but you didn't. I'm really impressed!""Walter replied, ""Well to be honest I almost said something when Ethel fell out but, you know, 50 dollars is 50 dollars!"""

Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500."""

0	Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian._____The prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that inhabited the area. Finally one day Justin said to Christian, 'I'm fed up with being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.'  A large mysterious cod appeared and said, 'Your wish is granted', and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark. Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate. Time passed and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely. All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight. While swimming alone one day he saw the cod again and he thought that perhaps he fish could change him back into a prawn. He approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and, lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.  With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realised he couldn't see his old pal.' Where's Christian?' he asked.' He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark', came the reply.  Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, 'It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.' Christian replied, 'No way man, you'll eat me. you're now a shark, the enemy and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.'  Justin cried back ' No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.' ...............  'I've found Cod. I'm a prawn again Christian'

0	Peyton Manning goes to heaven_____Peyton Manning, after living a full life, died. When he got to heaven, God was showing him around. They came to a modest little house with a faded Colts flag in the window. “This house is yours for eternity, Peyton,” said God. “This is very special; not everyone gets a house up here.” Peyton felt special, indeed, and walked up to his house. On his way up the sidewalk, he noticed another house just around the corner. It was a 3-story mansion with a blue and red sidewalk, a 50 foot tall flagpole with an enormous Patriots logo flag, and in every window hung a red Patriots towel. Peyton looked at God and said “God, I’m not trying to be ungrateful, but I have a question. I was an all-pro QB, I hold many NFL records, and I even went to the Hall of Fame.” “So what’s your point Peyton?”, God asked. “Well, why does Tom Brady get a better house than me?” God chuckled, and replied “Peyton, that’s not Tom’s house, it’s mine.”

0	"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon._____As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.After a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away.""The distressed woman wailed, ""Are you sure?""""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..""How can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or something.""The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $1,500."""

0	Timbuktu_____My dad was a mechanic, old school, he had a lot of jokes he told me. I've told some in comments but I guess a new post might be pertinent. Here is one:> The finals of the National Poetry Contest last year came down to two finalists. One was a San Francisco State University graduate from an upper-crust family; well-bred, well-connected and all that goes with it. The other finalist was a redneck from Texas A & M. Go figure.> The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word “Timbuktu.”> The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:> “'Slowly across the desert sandTrekked the dusty caravan.Men on camels, two by twoDestination -- Timbuktu.”> The audience went wild! How, they wondered if the redneck could top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:> “Tim and me, a-huntin' went.Met three whores in a pop-up tent.They was three, we was two,So I bucked one and Timbuktu”

Joe is unhappy because hell looks like more fun than heaven.  ""Well"" says St Peter its not quite as nice as it seems.

The ranch has thousands of cows across hundreds of acres of land, with a single cabin and a few goats in the yard.  The cowboys spend all day out on the range rounding up the herd, but luckily they have a hired chef to cook dinner for them every night.  One night, after a particularly long day of work, the cowboys start to gripe about their dinner.  The cowboys say to the chef ""can't you cook anything else? We eat the same crap every day!""  ""Oh my"" exclaims the chef. ""I thought you guys loved eating the same thing. I'll come up with a new recipe for tomorrow night.""The next night the cowboys come back to a newly prepared meal from the chef, so they sit down and start digging in.  The cowboys tear through the meal like it's the best food they've ever had. They all nod in agreement at how delicious this new dish is, until one cowboy looks out the window and realizes the yard is empty and there are no goats to be seen.  The cowboy immediately starts to cry.  The other cowboys realize what has happened and they begin to cry too. The chef comes in to see all of the cowboys in tears and asks ""oh no, did I fuck up the cooking?""The cowboys reply ""No, you cooked up our fucking!"""

0	An elder in the tribe tells a teenage member to prove his worth..._____The elder says to Flying Arrow, “to prove your worth, you must carve a totem that impresses the Chief, and you must do so with just this sharpened rock”  The boy accepts the challenge and begins punching out chunks of bark and then flesh from the wood. He soon realizes that he has no vision, as he has never done this before.  So he visits totems from the past that have pleased the Chiefs.  He sees a simple one and thinks, I can’t go wrong with this, after all, no one has seen it lately.  He uses the ancient totem as a guide to carving his own.  The end result ends up looking far better than the model and he cannot wait to go before the Chief and show him his creation.  The viewing ceremony begins.  The elder tells the boy, you must kneel before the Chief while he inspects your totem.  If he likes it, you must stand up and he will bestow you with a silver necklace which he will place around your neck.  If he is not impressed, you must lie face down with your head in the dirt until every guest has walked away.  The boy kneels before the Chief as the Chief makes a careful inspection of the totem.  Then the Chief stands before the boy and places his hand on the boy’s shoulder.  In a stern authoritative voice the Chief says, “You get down Arrow.  Just because you improved the punchline, doesn’t mean this isn’t a repost.”

Its not in the best shape, but it does work and you can have your friends in if you want,"" to which the first guy thanks him.St. Peter then turns to the second guy and asks him how many times he had cheated on his wife, to which the second guy responds with, ""I have only cheated on my wife once!""St. Peter points to a red, sports car and says, ""You will be riding around in this.

As they are approaching the gates of heaven they notice there are ducks that cover almost every inch of heaven.

Totally ruined the mood. Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let' just say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.Joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriendApparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could.In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where did you come from, where did you go?

0	Young King Arthur_____Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. The monarch could have killed him but was moved by Arthur's youth and ideals. So, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death. The question?....What do women really want? Such a question would   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young Arthur, it seemed an   impossible query. But, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end. He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. He spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. Many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.But the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. She agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first . The old witch wanted to marry Sir Lancelot, the most noble of the Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!Young Arthur was horrified. She was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. He had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life. He refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but Lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur. He said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the preservation of the Round Table. Hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered Arthur's question thus:What a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.Everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that Arthur's life would be spared. And so it was,   the neighboring monarch granted Arthur his freedom and Lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding. The honeymoon hour approached and Lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. But, what a sight awaited him. The most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. The astounded Lancelot asked what had happened . The beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half.Which would he prefer? Beautiful during the day....or night?  Lancelot pondered the predicament. During the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? Or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments? What would YOU do?What Lancelot chose is below. BUT.....make YOUR choice before   you scroll down below. OKAY?      Noble Lancelot said that he would allow HER to make the choice herself. Upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life. Now...what is the moral to this story?<Scroll Down>                      The moral is: If   you don't let a woman have her own way, things are going to get ugly...

He's spent his whole life researching scientific theories in his lab and wants to do something outside for a change, so he asks his assistant for a suggestion of something different to go and research.This assistant is a bit of a git and decides he'll play a prank on the old man, and suggests he research 'sheep shagging'.The professor thinks this is a great idea and heads off to Wales to begin his research.He heads out to the countryside and finds a farmer to quiz about his unnatural habits. The professor greets him and asks if he's got time to answer a couple of quick questions.""No problem boyo"" says the farmer, ""go right ahead.""Well,"" said the professor, ""what I'd like to know first is, do you own any sheep here?""""Of course boyo, biggest farm for miles round here I have. We've got loads of 'em""""Great, now the next question is a bit personal - do you use your sheep for sex?""""Ohh, too right boyo. There's three or four out there who are my particular favourites.""""So, how exactly do you... do it?""""Well, normally I take them down to the river, I slap their back feet in my wellies, the sheep pushes back from the water, bloody heaven boyo.""The professor thanks him and heads for the airport. Having heard about the Kiwis, he heads out to New Zealand with exactly the same plan. He finds a farm, talks to the farmer and gets the same responses.""Round up the sheep, head 'em up towards a cliff and off you go. Back feet in my boots, sheep pushing back from the cliff, bloody marvelous mate."" Again, the professor thanks him and decides that his research needs only one more addition. So he jets off to the world centre of sheep shagging, Australia. Once in Australia, he drives out to the bush, finds the biggest farm he can and knocks on the farmhouse door. He repeats his questions to the farmer. ""Too right mate. Usually I stick their back legs in me wellies, front legs over me shoulders and away we go!""""So the sheep faces you? That's strange - I've been talking to people around the world about this, and they all do it with the sheep facing away from them.""The Aussie is shocked. For a few seconds he can't speak, then he manages to stutter, ""What? No kissing?"""

Unfortunately for the musician he lived in a country ruled by a dictator. One day the dictator learns of the musician's talent and has the musician brought before him.The dictator gives the musician a task: compose and conduct a symphony to be played at the next political rally. Having no choice the musician agrees. He toils day and night for the next month, feverishly trying to create the perfect composition. When the day of the rally comes the musician confidently strides on stage, bows to the dictator, *tap tap taps* his baton on the music stand, and begins conducting. And the most godawful sound comes from the orchestra. Like nails on a chalkboard bad. The dictator is furious. He orders the musician to be executed the next day. After he's thrown in jail for the night, the musician asks if he can have a last meal. After deliberating the guards decide it wouldn't hurt anything. The musician orders the hottest curry the guards could find. As hot as it could possibly be. And he eats all of it right down to the last bit.The next morning comes and the guards haul the musician out of his cell, drag him to the execution chamber, and strap him into the electric chair. As they throw the switch the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The guards quickly turn off the power and start peering through the dissipating smoke. Much to their surprise the musician is sitting there unharmed. They quickly get the dictator on the phone and explain that the musician is still alive. The dictator decides to see the miracle musician for himself. Once the dictator arrives he sees the musician, who seems to be in a jovial mood. Enraged the dictator throws the electric chair switch again. Once again the lights begin to flicker, smoke starts billowing, and there's a massive *POP*. The dictator slowly turns off the power and allows the smoke to clear. Sure enough the musician is unscathed. ""How?! How are you still alive?!"" the dictator yells.The musician contemplates his answer for a moment and replies, ""Well, you see, I am an incredible musician. But sir...... I'm a terrible conductor."""

Everyone is stunned by this and start questioning the statement. The Chinese finally concede and say ""well... It will land within 3 inches of the target.""

Sato tried to make out any figures or objects in the cave but light only shone in about a few meters.""Toot toot toot,"" the tribe leader called out in a deep and nonchalant voice.The tribe leader edged towards the cave and cup his hand around his ear, awaiting a response.""Toot toot toot,"" a slightly higher pitched voice called back.The tribe leader quickly took off all his clothes and dashed into the cave, leaving Sato shocked and confused.About five minutes later, the tribe leader strolled out, sweating all over and panting in exhaustion.""What in the world just happened?!"" Sato asked frantically.The tribe leader laughed as he slowly put on his clothes.""We have a interesting culture here in this area; when you see a cave, you must call out like me and wait for a reply. If you hear reply, it mean that there are a beautiful woman inside wanting to have the sex and you must run in swiftly!""Sato was taken aback; he has never heard anything like it!The next day, he trekked alone into the mountain side and came across a smaller rain-forest where wet leaves littered the ground from a storm that morning.The tribe leader's words echoed in his mind and his curiosity was at an all time high; would the same thing happened?The damp atmosphere was relaxing as he briskly explored the rain-forest, capturing the beautiful African nature around him.Lo and behold, right next to the mountains was an extremely huge cave that stood about two to three times his height.He was exhilarated! A cave this huge must mean many women who could be bustier or more sexually active. He put down his belongings and called out as loud as he could,""Toot toot toot!""He paused and listened.But there was no reply.""Toot toot toot!!""He called even louder.Again, silence.Sato was furious, he refused to be robbed of this golden opportunity. He took a gulp of water and braced for the loudest call of his life.""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""Almost immediately, the cave shrieked back in an extremely solemn voice that was twice as loud.**""TOOT TOOT TOOT!""**Sato was on cloud nine, he tore through his clothes with utmost joy and sprinted into the cave.The next morning, on the front page of the African Daily,**MYSTERY SURROUNDS DEATH OF A NAKED ASIAN MAN ON NORTH-EAST RAILROAD**"

I am so, so proud of my son. Nearly everyone on earth has heard of him—to say he’s a household name would be a huge understatement. Children grow up learning about him in school and at home. Countless books have been written about him, and his story has inspired people for hundreds of years.

He's having a party on Saturday, and the man is invited. ""This sounds great!"" the man thinks to himself. ""I've been here alone these past few months, and I'm starting to get a little lonely. Meeting the rest of the neighbors sounds like a pretty good time.""He says yes, and Lars is very happy to hear so. Before he goes, Lars gives him a warning: ""Just so you know, there's probably going to be some poker or other card games. I don't know how you feel about gambling, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man, having gone to a weekly guys poker night in his life in NYC, says he's totally fine with it. Lars speaks up again: ""Also, there's probably going to be some drinking. Lots of drinking. I don't know how you feel about alcohol, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" The man hasn't been drunk much since he left NYC, thinks it'll be a great change of pace, and says that sounds good!Lars speaks up one last time: ""There's a good chance there's going to be a lot of sex. These parties can get a little out of hand. I don't know how you feel about orgies, but some folks around here aren't too keen on it."" After his wild life in NYC, the man is no stranger to wild sexual experiences, and after several months of no sex, he agrees.Lars seems pleased, and turns to leave.The man stops him and asks: ""Wait, you forgot to tell me what time on Saturday.""Lars replies: ""You can swing by anytime you want. It's just going to be the two of us."""

I can cut down trees twice the size of that in just 6 chops.""From the other side of the fire, someone says, ""That's impressive alright. But, I can cut down trees of that size with just 2 swings of my axe.""The lumberjacks pause for a second, and take a look at the man who said that: a tall and scrawny older man who didn't even look like he could swing an axe. They burst into laughter.The older man let them calm down before he began again. He said, ""Alright, if you don't believe me, lets put it to the test then. You pick the strongest man from your group and find 2 evenly sized trees. I guarantee I'll knock it down in less swings than him.""The other lumberjacks, holding back their laughter now, look up and pick the biggest and strongest guy in their group. They find 2 large and evenly sized trees. The strongest man steps up to his tree and takes a swing. Then he takes 5 more well placed swings and the tree falls. He looks over at the old man and says, ""Ok, your turn.""The old man steps up to his tree and, sure enough, in two swings of his axe, the tree falls.The other lumberjacks look at him with awe as they gather around the fire again. Finally, one of them breaks the silence with a gentle question. ""How'd you do it? You don't even look like you can swing an axe and yet you took down the biggest tree we could find with just 2 swings!""The old man paused and looked around the group. ""Have you ever heard of the Sahara Forest?"" he asked.""You mean the Sahara Desert?"" asked one of the other lumberjacks.The old man looked back with a smile and said, ""so is that what they're calling it now?"""

1	3 nuns have dedicated their lives to God since they were 16._____25 years later they started talking about everything in life they missed out on. Never getting a drivers license, to their first drink at 21, or even having sex.So they all decided they would go to their priest and ask if they can have 1 day off from being a nun. As this is a weird request the priest says “Yes, only if each one of you do something bad.”They all agree and off their separate ways. When the first nun comes back the priest asks her about her day. And she tells him all about how amazing it was driving around in a Ferrari. Stumped upon how she was driving a Ferrari he asks the nun how she was able to drive a Ferrari. She responds “You told me to do something bad. So I robbed a bank and bought a Ferrari.”In shock the priest told her to go drink some holy water to cleanse herself. And just as he starting to catch his breathe the second nun comes back. And she instantly starts telling him how great her day at the beach was wearing a bikini. And the priest feeling responsible now asks how she got the bikini. She responds ”I had to drown a lady to get it.”The priest baffled by what he just heard again tells her to drink the holy water to cleanse herself of the horrific crime she committed. The last nun walks in and tells the priest she had a great day just walking around the park. And he knew he had to ask. “Did you do anything bad?” She responds calmly “No, not really, I just peed in the holy water before I left.”

The real cause of what happened today was Australian government allowing to import and to produce eggs in their country in the first place.

0	Three men meet Buddha after their deaths_____ Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.\-Raise your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have much to accomplish yet though.One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.\-Benevolent Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.\-My work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.\-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.\-I know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.The three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.\-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?\-Who? M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember. During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and vegetables.\-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?\-Oh...that one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.\-This is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?\-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

0	An Irishman has been shipwrecked and stranded on an island for over 20 years. [MEDIUM]_____One day, on his daily walk of the beach, he sees something way out in the ocean. At first he couldn’t make out what it was, as it got closer, he could see something red. Finally, it was close enough to determine that the red was actually the hair of a woman. A very pretty dame in her 20s. When she arrived on shore she was surprised to find anyone there, as this is a very remote island. She walks up to the Irishman and asks him how he got there. He says “I haven’t seen another soul in over 20 years since I was shipwrecked and stranded here.”She says 20 years you say? Well, that’s a long time to go without a drink, she pulls down her wetsuit zipper a bit, reaches in and pulls out a bottle of Irish whiskey. How would you like a drink?He obliges and takes a couple of swallows. “Bless your heart, that’s the best tasting whiskey I’ve had in me whole life.”She says It’s been a long time since you’ve had a smoke, would you like a cigarette?He happily obliges and she pulls the wetsuit zipper down even farther and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and some matches. He lights the cigarette, has a few drags and says “Bless your heart, that’s the best cigarette I’ve had in me whole life.”She then says So you’ve been stranded here for over 20 years, how’d you like to play around? She pulls the wetsuit zipper down the rest of the way, exposing her naked body. He responds “ Oh bless your heart, you’ve got a set of clubs in there have you?”

0	Murphy and O'Brien calculate the depth of a well_____Murphy and O'Brien go out into the woods, they come a clearing and see an abandoned well.  Murphy said 'I wonder how deep that well is?' O'Brien said, 'There's one way we could figure it out'.  Murphy says, 'What's that?' O'Brien says, 'We drop something down it, we time how long it takes to hit the bottom, you multiply that time 32 feet per second squared, the rate at which objects fall in a vacuum, subtract a little for wind resistance and we've got the depth of the well'.  Murphy says, ' What are you going to drop down it?'  Then O'Brien looked all around and he saw this big heavy log lying on the ground. Next he squats down by the log and, using his legs correctly, he gets it up onto his shoulders and staggers over to the edge of the well, tips it up, drops it into the well and they start to count, 'One hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three .................... '  SPLASH!!!!  Murphy said, 'Three seconds!' O'Brien said, 'Quick, multiply that time 32 feet per second squared!' '288 feet!', Murphy said. 'Subtract a little for wind resistance, let's say 18 feet. The depth of that well is 270 feet deep'.  As he finished the calculation Murphy shouts, 'LOOK OUT!!' and he pushed O'Brien backwards and a goat ran between them and jumped head first down the well. Murphy said, 'My God, I've never seen anything like that'.  Just then a farmer walks into the clearing and said, 'What's going on here boys?' O'Brien says, 'We just figured out the depth of this well to be about 270 feet deep and then the strangest thing happened. A goat ran between the two of us and jumped head first down into the well.'  The farmer says, 'Thank heaven it wasn't one of my goats.' Murphy says, 'How do you know it wasn't?' And the farmer says, 'Because all of my goats are tethered to big heavy logs.'
0	The Advice_____Jack was most handsome man in the world, blessed with having whichever woman he desired.In the beginning, shortly after he realized the true potential of the gift he possessed, he assumed he could keep doing this forever. “I’m a lucky bastard”, he muttered to himself. But by the fifth relationship, he was tired of it.As fate would have it, the next woman he met was perfect in every way. Soon enough, they fell in love and Jack had never been happier. A year passed and Jack began to wonder if he was wasting the gift he had! And one doubt led to another, and before he knew it he was back on the road to casual relationships. Several years and casual relationships later, Jack would still feel a void that he was unable to fill. It was around then that he heard of a strange wise man, who gave everyone just one vague advice and yet it would make sense to each seeker in their own way. Jack decided to go seek his advice. Having listened to Jack’s story, the wise man smiled an all knowing smile, and said “Jack, you’ll find all your problems solved, if you simply go back to bae six.”

""What's that there jar for?""""A few months after he came some of my regular customers started making bets. Who ever can make that horse to do anything other than sit there and mourn takes the jar and all the money in it.""Upon hearing this the Cowboy shook his head, drained his mug in one gulp, wiped his lips, stood up and walked over to the horse. The bartender watched in surprise as the cowboy sat down next to the horse and whispered in the horses ear. The tears in the horses eyes remained but no longer were they tears of sorrow. The horse erupted in a violent fit of laughter so loud in could be heard from the street outside the saloon. The cowboy, satisfied with his work stood up, grabbed the jar of money, tipped his hat to the bartender (who at this point was in a state of utter disbelief) and walked out the door.A year later the same traveling cowboy walked into the same saloon and sat down in the same spot he had the year prior. As he sat down he turned his gaze to the far side of the bar and quite to his surprise the horse was still there. Another jar had replaced the one he had taken, and the horse was still possessed by a state of violent laughter. ""YOU!"" Yelled the bartender who had just turned and recognized the face of the traveling cowboy. ""You think you can come back into my saloon after what you've done? That horse has not stopped laughing since the day you came in here and made him do so! It's been so disruptive I can't get anyone to come in here besides my regulars, and all they do is bet on that damned horse. Who ever can get him to do anything other than THAT takes the jar and all of its contents.""""Well I'll be."" Says the cowboy as he stood up and slowly walked over to the horse.The bartender watched as the cowboy made his way to the far side of the bar. He watched the cowboy stand in front of the horse with his back facing the bartender. The bartender watched in an almost euphoric state of shock as the horse's laughter stopped. As the cowboy stood there, the horses countenance fell to the same state it was one year prior. Tears welled up in his eyes and he began to weep once again.Satisfied with his work the cowboy grabbed the new jar and again tipped his hat to the bartender as he made his way to the door.""Wait just a goddamn minute!"" The bartender screamed.""I beg your pardon?"" The cowboy replied as he turned and began walking back toward the bar.""Well hell. You come in here one year ago and you say somthing to that horse, which mind you, had not done nothin' but cry and mourn for one year prior to your arrival. Something so goddamn funny that he then cannot do anything but laugh and be disruptive for the next year, driving away all my customers. Then you come in here now and just stand there and he stops!? You put me through all that and you're just gonna walk out of this saloon without so much as a goodbye? Well that don't sit right with me. So I demand that you tell me what you did to that horse to make his laugh and then cry like that.""""I guess I do owe you that bartender."" Says the travelling Cowboy. ""Well a year ago when I came In here and that horse was crying I went up to him and I told him as that my dick was bigger than his."" ""What in the hell are you talking about?"" Says the bartender in a very sarcastic tone. "" You expect me to believe that? Well mr. Big dick cowboy, what did you tell him today to get him to stop?""""I didn't tell him nothin'"" says the cowboy as a grin as big as Texas spread across his face. ""Today I showed him."" "

0	"The Ballad of Joe Balogey_____ Joe Balogey was 99 years old and in his death bed. He'd been given mere days to live and was sure to die in the night if not sooner. Still, he woke up that morning feeling light as a feather and smelling a delicious and familiar nostalgic smell in the air. ""Oh!"" he cried, ""My loving wife of 78 years Lorraine has baked my favorite treat on this, my last day of life, most likely; chocolate chip cookies!"" And with that, Joe Balogey rolled off his bed and hit the floor, cracking three ribs and displacing both hips. Unable to stand, he clawed himself down the stairs inches at a time in agony as his frail body dragged across the cold wood floor. Still, the pain was worth every second as he reached the kitchen to see hundreds of chocolate chip cookies cooling upon the counters and table of their family home of so many years which Joe Balogey had built himself for his loving wife Lorraine 64 years before. ""Oh, my loving, dear, sweet, ever supporting wife, she's made such wonderful treats for me."" And as Joe reached up to grab a cookie off the table a wooden spoon smacked his hand sharply. ""JOE"" screamed Lorraine, ""THOSE ARE FOR THE WAKE!"" "

1	"The farmer and his wife needed a new bull..._____There was a man who lived on a farm with his wife in the middle of nowhere. All they owned was a truck, a few cows, and an old bull. They didn't have much, but they were happy. One day, the farmer woke up and found that the bull had died. He went to his wife and said, ""I take our money into the town and buy us a new bull. I know you need the truck here to keep the farm running, so when I get us a bull, I'll send you a telegraph so you know when to pick us up.""His wife went and got the money and then said goodbye.The farmer arrived in town late that day and had to get a hotel room. The next morning he only had 401 dollars left. He went to the market and was able to buy a strong, young bull with the 400 dollars. It had been a long time since he had been to town, but as long as the telegraph prices hadn't gone up, he should be able to send a full sentence to his wife with his dollar.When he arrived at the post office, he said to the telegraph operator: ""I need to send a message to my wife so she can pick up my bull and I. How much is a word?""""Prices went up a few years ago,"" replied the operator. ""A word is 1 dollar.""""Oh no,"" said the farmer ""I can only send one word!"" He thought for a little while and then said, ""Ok, send my wife the word 'comfortable.'""""Comfortable? Are you sure?"" asked the operator.""My wife has a 4th grade education,"" the farmer replied. ""When she reads she has to sound each word out syllable by syllable. So when she sees the word comfortable, she'll read it as 'come-for-ta-bull.'"""

0	A midget walks into a brothel._____The first thing the midget does is pull out a large stack of crisp $100 bills.

The woman heads upstairs and immediately comes back down laughing hysterically. The head mistress asks “what is so funny” The hooker says : “Well I went up there and when it came time for us to get naked I noticed he had a little tiny penis with a tattoo that said ‘Stumpy’ on it.” The mistress is not happy. She explains this man has a lot of money and she should be professional. Overhearing the conversation is a second employee. She immediately goes up to the mistress who is now frantically looking for an employee who isn’t laughing at the tattoo. “Let me go, I can keep it together”Again she comes down after about a minute laughing. “He does have a tattoo on his little tiny penis that says stumpy” The mistress is red in the face with anger! “This is a paying customer with more money in his pocket than most customers combined! I guess I will have to take care of him myself!”Being a former working girl the mistress adjust her outfit in the mirror before heading up stairs. All the hookers wait downstairs for her to come down laughing but there is silence. After about 3 minutes the chandelier begins to shake and there’s very very loud aggressive sexual noises coming from upstairs. The other hookers are confused.After around an hour the mistress comes downstairs to a large group of waiting employees who had been hearing the commotion and gathered in confusion and curiosity. The mistress’ hair is a mess, her dress is haphazardly put back on and her make up is destroyed. All the hookers seem confused. So the first girl who went up to the midget asks her boss “did you see it? Did you see the tattoo that said stumpy” The mistress looks at her and says “yes I did see the tattoo that says stumpy. But once I gave him a hard on it said ‘Stumpy and Steve’s bar and grill in Amarillo, Texas”
0	Ben and Jerry were friends in college..._____Ben and Jerry were friends in college. Two stoners with big ideas about peace, love and understanding. Mostly, of course, they’d just get high in their dorm room on some pills that Jerry would concoct and eat snacks that Ben would whip together.Then college ended and the two drifted apart. Moved to different towns and lost contact. Just how it goes sometimes.It is a couple of years onward and Ben is walking down the street. Life isn’t going too well. He is out of a job and out of purpose. He pulls his jacket tighter in the cold autumn wind. All of a sudden this big ass limousine is honking its horn behind him. ”Wtf!” exclaims Ben, as the car pulls up to him and the back door opens. ”What kind of douchebag drives around in a limousine honking the horn like that”.”Ben!” shouts a familiar voice from the back seat. Wouldn’t you know, it’s Jerry!”Come inside old friend! Long time no see!” Jerry is sitting in the limousine with a big entourage. The champagne is flowing and it’s clear who the sugar daddy of the party is: Jerry. Jerry the slacking hippie from college. Ben cannot believe his eyes. So after a couple friendly glasses of catching up he asks his former bff: ”Jerry I’ve gotta ask, what happened? In college you were mostly into smoking pot and eating ice cream and now….this!?” ”Well” responds Jerry. ”You know it wasn’t long ago I was working a dead end job and feeling really miserable. But then one day I decided to do something with my life. Tap into the great american entrepreneurial spirit and start a company.” ”Ok, that sounds cool I guess” answers Ben. ”But so what did you do to become this successful?””Well, you know how I’ve always had a knack for mixing with pills? Yeah so I invented a pill that when eaten by a chick, makes her pussy tastes of ice cream!””You’re kidding!” Shouts Ben. You’re THAT guy!? I read about that!And so the night goes on and the two former friends party like they’re back in college. They get high, they have a few laughs and come morning they say their goodbyes and wow to hook up again in the future. At least they try, but you know how it goes. Time passes and friendships fade.A couple of years onward a man is walking down the street. He pulls his jacket tighter in the cold autumn wind. It’s Jerry. Gone are his fortunes and his good mood. Turns out pills that makes chicks pussy taste ice cream was just a fad. Pair that with some stupid investments and an unsustainable lifestyle and Jerry is now as broke as when he started. Out of money and out of purpose.”Honk! Honk!” Jerry turns around. The biggest, fanciest limousine that has ever been seen is driving down the street. ”Wtf!” exclaims Jerry ”What kind of douchebag….” ”Jerry my friend, long time no see, come inside!”. Wouldn’t you know it, it’s Ben!Ben is sitting with a huge entourage inside a jacuzzi inside the limo. Jerry cannot believe his eyes. The most expensive champagne is flowing and everybody is having a good time on Bens dime. So Jerry hops in the jacuzzi and shares a drink with his old friend. ”But Ben, I’ve gotta ask” says Jerry. ”Last time I saw you things weren’t that great, you were poor as a pine cone, what happened?””Well funny you should ask” replies Ben. ”You see, after I saw you in your limo all those years ago, I said to myself: If Jerry can make something of himself, so can I! And so remember how I always had a knack for whipping up the best desserts?” ”Sure” replies Jerry ”You where the best back in college.” ”Yeah, well so I thought long and hard what product I could make that would make me rich” says Ben. ”And then one day I got it: so I invented ice cream that tastes pussy!”

She gets on the plane, goes to her seat in economy class, window seat. She makes herself comfortable and tries to get some sleep. Another woman comes and sits next to her. The other woman looks a bit odd, too much makeup, too much jewelry, too much cosmetic surgeries, you know, too much Botox, too much lip fillers. Anyway. Mrs. Parker and the lady exchange greetings and the flight takes off. As Mrs. Parker is just about to doze off, the other lady elbows her a little bit. ""Excuse me"" the woman says, ""I didn't even introduce myself. My name is Baroness Von Hildebrand."" Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Uh, my name is Mrs. Parker, it's very nice meeting you Miss, Mrs... uh"" ""Baroness."" ""Oh, sorry, Baroness"" And Mrs. Parker tries to sleep again. A minute goes by and she's elbowed again. The baroness says, ""You know it's the first time I'm actually sitting in economy class. First time in my life. I've always been a first-class passenger. But today, somehow, First class is full and I really needed to be on this plane. So, here I am in economy class. To be honest, it's not too bad. I mean, I'm sitting here with the masses, with the little people, and, you know, it's nice.""Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well that's very nice, very nice."" and she tries to sleep again. Not a full minute goes by and she's elbowed again.""By the way, you know, I'm only in this lack of luxury for this short flight to London. As soon as we arrive, my chauffeur will be waiting for me in my limousine. And I will be back in the luxuries of life that I've always known. I can't wait for that to happen.""Mrs. Parker looks on and says, ""Well that's very nice. Very nice. But, I really need to get some sleep."" and she tries to sleep againAnother minute goes by and she's elbowed again.""Do you know why I'm able to afford all these luxuries of life? It's because of my husband. My husband is the CEO of one of the top 100 companies in the world. He makes no less than a hundred million dollars a year on any given year, and so we live a wonderful, fantastic, luxurious life, every single day of our lives.""Mrs. Parker looks at her and says ""uh, well... very nice, very nice."" And tries to sleep againSome few seconds later.""And by the way, do you have children? Mrs...? I forgot your name.""""Mrs. Parker. Yes, I've got one son. He works in a grocery store right now. He's trying to--""""Yeah, well, you know, I've got two sons. My two sons are the most wonderful sons, the most wonderful kids any parent could dream of having. They're handsome. They're healthy. They're smart. They're both in their early 20s, and they're already making so much money. I love them so much, the best children in the world.""Mrs. Parker looks at her and says: ""Oh, very nice, very nice."" and tries to get some sleep again.""By the way, I'm on vacation. This holiday started in Thailand. I went to Thailand, spent two wonderful weeks there. Then went to Bali for another two beautiful weeks, then went to the Caribbean for another two weeks, and finally went to Austria and Germany where I attended the opera and saw the most wonderful pieces of music, ballet, and opera.""""Oh, well, that's very nice, very nice. But, I really should get some sleep now."" says Mrs. Parker.""This whole trip that I've done, this whole vacation, this whole holiday, was paid for by my husband. It was a gift for my birthday. Every year he tries to get me a better gift. What did your husband buy you for your last birthday?""So, Mrs. Parker looks at her and says, ""Well, we are of limited means, but for my last birthday, my husband paid for me to take some English classes.""""English classes?! That's ridiculous! How cheap! Why would he buy you English classes? You're English, you speak English! It doesn't make any sense. Did you even learn anything from those classes?""Mrs. Parker says ""Well, actually I did. Those classes have been quite beneficial to me. It's improved the way I speak quite a lot. For instance, before going to those english classes, I used to say 'go fuck yourself' quite a lot...""""...but now I say 'very nice'."""

The horse looks in and an amazing guitarist is playing and the horse thinks to himself, ""I want to be able to play the guitar like this guy.” So the horse calls up the local music teacher and says, ""Hi, I would like to learn how to play the guitar, but there's one problem, I'm a horse.” The music teacher responds, ""That's not a problem! We have sophisticated technology that could allow any horse to learn how to play the guitar!""So the horse starts learning how to play, and he is getting really good. One day while practicing in the barn, a cow walks by and hears the horse play. The cow says to the horse, ""Wow, you are really good! I would love to learn to play the drums so I could play with you.” The horse responds, ""Call up the music teacher, I'm sure she'll teach you how to play the drums!"" So the cow calls up the music teacher and says, ""I would love to learn how to play the drums, but there's one problem, I'm a cow.” The music teacher replies, “That's not a problem! We have sophisticated technology that could allow any cow to learn to play the drums!"" So the cow starts learning how to play the drums, and he is getting really good at them. One day while the cow and horse are practicing together in the barn, a chicken walks by and hears the horse and the cow playing. He is astonished how good they are and says, “Wow, you guys are great! I would love to learn how to play the bass so I could play with you!"" The horse responds, ""Call up the music teacher, I'm sure she'd be able to teach you how to play the bass!"" So the chicken calls up the music teacher and says, ""I would love to learn how to play the bass, but there's one problem, I'm a chicken.” The music teacher responds, ""That's not a problem! We have sophisticated technology that could allow any chicken to learn how to play the bass!"" So pretty soon the cow, chicken, and the horse start practicing together, and they are getting really good. One day during one of their practice sessions in the barn, a talent agent walks by and hears them play, he is astounded how good they are, so he says, ""Wow, you guys sound amazing! If you sign me on as your agent, I could have you going across the world, seeing different countries, partying with lots of women, and making tons of money with your band!"" The animals are delighted by this offer so they accept. The talent scout was entirely right, after signing him on, the band members were playing concerts all over the world, partying with lots of beautiful women, and making tons of money. One day while wanting for a flight for their next concert the horse gets a phone call, his mother was put in the hospital. So the horse tells the band, ""You guys go to the next concert, I'll catch up later."" The horse gets to the hospital with his mother and everything is fine, she had a minor fall but would get over it quickly. Unfortunately on the hospital room's TV there was a news report, the plane the cow and chicken were in crashed, and there were no survivors. The horse had just lost his fellow band members and his best friends. The band was over and he's probably have to go back to living on the farm again. So the horse goes into the closest bar. The bartender can see in the horse's eyes that he is really sad, so he walks up to the horse and says, ""Why the long face?"""

For three hours, he stuck his thumb out and no one stopped.  Eventually, a dude in a Corvette pulled over and offered to give him a ride. However, the bike couldn't fit in the car. The owner of the Corvette found a piece of rope lying by the highway and tied one end to his bumper. He tied the other end to the bike and told the man that if he was going too fast, to simply honk the horn on his bike and that he would slow down.   Twenty miles later, another Corvette flew past the two. Not willing to be outdone, the Corvette pulling the bike took off after the other. A short distance down the road, the Corvettes, both going well over 110 mph, flew through a speed trap. The officer noted the speeds from his radar gun and radioed to another officer that he had two Corvettes headed his way at over 110 mph. He then said, ''...and you're not going to believe this, but there's guy on a bike honking to pass.''

0	"A drunk man borrows and loses his partner's prosthetic leg in a game of roulette in Las Vegas while she's asleep in their room. When she wakes up in the morning she is furious and sends him down to the tables to win it back..._____..the man, now sober, is absolutely determined to make up for his sordid late night misdeed, and immediately challenges the casino to win back the prosthetic leg.For the whole next day he is at the table, losing pile after pile of chips, thousands and thousands of dollars at a time. Soon, a small crowd is gathered round him, watching, as this intense game goes on and on. One observer taps the man on the shoulder and he turns irritably.""How long are you going to do this?"" The observer asks.""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds shortly.Pausing only to relieve himself in a bucket provided by the casino, the man continues to play for the leg through the night and into the next day. Money seems to be no issue for him, he never sleeps and he never seems to tire either.Now a huge crowd is gathered around him as he reaches the end of his first week trying to win back the leg. No-one can believe how much this man wants to make up for his transgression. People begin to praise the man on social media. The casino manager makes his way through the crowd on the floor to approach the man, who does not take lightly to being interrupted in his so far frivolous pursuit.""How long are you going to do this?"" The manager asks.""As long as it takes to win back this leg."" The man responds, barely looking away from the table.A month passes and still sadly unsuccessful, the man does not waiver in his efforts to win back the leg. Now the casino is the biggest attraction in Las Vegas. People pay just to watch the man relentlessly and seemingly without fatigue play over and over again, despite the overwhelming bad-luck he is experiencing. The man's mother is cleared to approach the man.""How long are you going to do this?"" His mother asks.""As long as it takes to win back this leg!"" The man responds, barely looking away from the table. Six months pass and the man is STILL at the table, he is being fed through a tube and has a catheter installed along with an adult diaper, so now even his ablutions do not hamper his attempts to win back the leg.A TV crew finally breaks through the crowd which by now stretches out the edges of the Las Vegas strip. The reporter excitedly gets a microphone into the man's face.""How long are you going to do this?"" The reporter asks.""Look I've told you!"" The man roars. ""I'm going to do this for the rest of my wife!"""

0	"Frog_____There was this little boy about 10 years old walking down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. He walked up to a whore house and knocked on the door. When the Madam answered, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. He said, ""I want to have sex with one of the women inside. I have the money and I'm not leaving until I do."" The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked. He asked, ""Do any of the girls have any diseases?"" Of course, the Madam said no. He said,""I heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making it with Amber. THAT'S the girl I want!"" Since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him to go to the first room on the right. He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, ""Why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?"" He said, ""Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving me at home with my baby-sitter. After they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of little boys. She will get the disease that I just caught. When Mom and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease, because that damn mailman is the son-of-a-bi\*ch who ran over my FROG!"" "

0	Businessman_____ There was a businessman who was sure that his wife was cheating on him, so he put her under surveillance. One day at work, he got a call that told him to rush home quickly and he would be able to catch her in the act. So he rushed home to his 20th floor hi-rise apartment and burst into the room. His wife was there, but he didn’t see anyone else.“Where is he?” he shouted.“Where is who?” demanded his wife.“Don’t play coy with me sugar.” he said, and began to search the apartment.He looked in the bedroom; no one.He looked under the bed; no one.He looked in every closet; no one.Finally he heard a noise out on the balcony. He looked and saw a man hanging by his fingers from the balcony! Enraged, the man started stomping on his fingers. The man screamed, but stubbornly held on. Even more enraged, the business man went into the apartment and brought out a hammer. He then began hitting the man’s fingers and watched triumphantly as the man fell 20 stories. But to his dismay the man fell into a bush. Although badly injured, he wasn’t dead. The business man was livid! He went into his kitchen and rolled his refrigerator out to the balcony. He heaved it over the edge and watched with glee as the refrigerator landed on the injured man; killing him. The business man started to laugh, but mid-laugh grabbed his chest and died from a massive heart attack……..The business man found himself in line before the Pearly Gates. St. Peter was there and it was clear that there was a delay. St. Peter said,“I’m sorry, but heaven is full today, we’re only letting in folks who have died in a very stressful way.”“Well I died today full of stress,” said the business man.“Really,” said St. Peter, “Do tell.”So the business man related the above story. St. Peter was swayed.“OK,” he said, “You can go in.”The next guy in line stepped up. St. Peter told him the same thing.“Did you die in a stressful way?”“Did I? And how!!” replied the man. And he related the following story to St. Peter.I was doing my Jazzercise tape in my living room on the 21st floor of my hi-rise apartment when I kinda lost track of where I was. I accidentally fell off my balcony, and was plummeting to my sure death, when miraculously I was able to grab onto the balcony below mine. I was hanging on but just barely, when a man came out. Thank God I thought, I’m saved. But to my horror, he started stomping on my fingers. It hurt terribly, but I was able to hang on. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore; he stopped and went back inside. Thank God I thought. But just then, he comes back out with a hammer and starts to hammer my fingers! Well I had to let go and I fell into a bush. Although badly injured, I was still alive, and I was just about to yell for help when I looked up just in time to see a refrigerator heading right for me…….And the next thing I know….I’m here.St. Peter’s mouth was hanging open. All he could do was gesture the man inside.“Go in, go on in,” was all he could whisper.After a few moments to collect himself, St. Peter said, “Next!”The next guy steps up, and after being told the condition for entry, St. Peter asks,“Did you die stressfully?’’“Yes I did, and here’s my story……I was hiding in this refrigerator and………..

Two months ago, my husband, Phil, was in a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""A muffled gasp arose from the men in the congregation as the thought of the pain poor Phil must have experienced sank in.""Phil was hurt so badly that he couldn't even hold me or the kids,"" Suzie continued. ""Every movement caused terrible pain. We prayed when his doctors performed the delicate operation required to repair the extensive damage. Luckily they were able to piece the crushed and broken remnants of Phil's scrotum together and wrap it in wire to hold everything in place.""Again, the male half of the congregation squirmed uncomfortably, cringing at the thought of what Phil went through.""Today,"" Suzie announced in a quivering voice, ""Thanks to the Lord, Phil is out of the hospital. His doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""A great sigh of relief arose from the pews. The shaken pastor stood and tentatively asked if anyone else had anything to say.A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. He looked around the congregation and said, ""I'm Phil."" The entire assembly held its collective breath.""I just want to tell my wife that the word is sternum."""

Yes i do own a lawn. Then Logically you own a house. Yes, yes i do own a house says Steve. Then Logically you have a family, which would then logically mean you have have a wife which would logically mean you are heterosexual.

They go into the island to see if they can find any food. They happen to stumble upon an enormous cache of perfectly ripe fruits. They eat to their heart’s delight, and when they are all about to fall asleep, five enormous, muscled, tattooed people step out, wielding clubs.“You have stolen from our people! We shall take you to our leader, for he will know what to do.” So the men are dragged to the center of the island, and soon face the leader of the tribe they were taken captive by.“You have stolen from our people! This is punishable by death! However, since you are foreigners, I have another option for you. iki Shiki.” The first man asks, “What is iki Shiki?!” “I know it by no other name. The choice is yours. Death, or iki Shiki.”The first man says this, “Well, nothing is worse than death. So I choose iki Shiki!”“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!! IKI SHIKI!”The man is dragged into a cave by three hulking warriors, even bigger than the ones that took them to the chief. For a few moments, there is complete silence. And then, the other two men hear something. “Oh god! What are you doing?! No! NO! STOP! PLEASE! PLEASE, OH GOD PLEASE!!” Then they start hearing awful screams, like nothing on this earth. This goes on for six hours. Finally, the man stops screaming. He exits the cave, pants off.  Blood is streaming out of his ass and flecks of shit cover him. He sits down and starts crying immediately. The second man is then given the same choice. “Well, that seems pretty horrible. But nothing can be worse than death. So I too choose iki Shiki.”“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!! IKI SHIKI!” The same warriors drag the second man into the cave. The iki Shiki has begun. The second man starts screaming. He keeps on screaming, never stopping, and the first man starts crying harder and harder. After eight hours, the second man comes out of the cave. His clothes are ripped to shreds and blood is covering his entire body. He lies down in fetal position and starts shaking violently. The third and final man then must choose his fate. “Well, before today, I thought nothing was worse than death. But I was wrong. So that is what I choose.”“Very well. IT IS DECIDED!!!! DEATH! BY IKI SHIKI!!!!!!”

The student leaves without looking at the paper. However, he returns shortly, gives back his paper and says:'Excuse me sir, you did sign my paper, but you forgot to give my grade!'"

""Jump as high as you can!

Should be nothing to worry about, we will still be landing safely very soon"". Bart shrugged off the incident and figured if that's the worst thing that happens today, it would still be a success.A half hour later, another shudder went through the plane, the passengers gasped, and the pilot came on the PA again. ""Friends, we have lost power to another engine. We still have two functioning engines, and we should have no problems reaching our destination. We apologize for the issues."" Bart was starting to feel slightly uneasy now, but was still confident they would reach Berlin.Later, about 20 minutes out from their destination, another vibration was felt and the plane listed to the right for a few moments, then stabilized. The pilot made another announcement, this time more nervously, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost power to a third engine. We still hope to make it to Berlin safely, please remain calm."" Bart and the other passengers were now visibly shaken, praying that the last functional engine held out until they could land.Thankfully, the plane reached Berlin and landed safely. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as they taxied to the gate and began to deplane. As Bart gathered his things, he laughed and remarked to the man seated next to him, ""It's a good thing we didn't lose that last engine, or we would have been up there all night!"""

0	"Twist & expansion of the ""fly in the beer"" story_____A bar in FRANCE has an amateur social scientist as a bartender.  He's decided to put flies into the beers of a customers, to measure and document the reactions of people of different nationalities.  Since he fancies himself as a chivalrous gentleman, he doesn't do this with female customers (actually, he doesn't want to ruin any chance he has of getting them into his bed, or the back room.)  So his targets are men.&#x200B;Here is his experiment journal.&#x200B;Monday:Subject #1: Englishman, age approximately 40.  Called me over and said he couldn't drink the beer because of the fly and demanded another on the house.&#x200B;Subject #2: Welshman, age approximately 50-60.  Called me over and flicked the fly at me while swearing in Welsh.  Then he started sipping his beer as if nothing happened.&#x200B;Tuesday:Subject #3: Irishman, age approximately 65.  Was so drunk that he didn't notice the fly, gulping it down with the beer, then ordered another ""jus' da same"".  I obliged him.  Four more flies later, he settled his tab, and made his way out of the bar in a less than straight line.&#x200B;Subject #4: American, age approximately 25.  Yelled at me to come back, threw the beer in my face, and started a bar brawl.&#x200B;Wednesday: Dedicated to repairing bar, no customers.&#x200B;Thursday:Subject #5: Scotsman, age approximately 35.  Horrified upon seeing the fly (I think you know where this is going), picked it out of the beer and screamed at it repeatedly, ""Spit it out!  Spit it out!"".  For the next beer, he demanded an extra ounce on the house, on account of the fly having drunk some of his previous beer.&#x200B;Subject #6: Canadian, age approximately 25-30.  Very quiet.  When he paid for his beer, the fly was on the Euro bills and he said, ""No thank you.  You can have the fly back.""&#x200B;Friday:Subject #7: German, age approximately 30-40.  Demanded to see the manager and complained to her that I had dishonoured his fine beverage.  Suggested to my manager that I was unfit for my job, and that he deserved the most expensive beer we have for free as compensation.&#x200B;My manager questioned me about the fly, suspicious.  She's smarter than I thought, despite her not sleeping with me.  She asked me about the brawl on Tuesday, if I had done something to set off the American.  I said it might be possible, but who knows what sets them off?  She agreed, but warned me that if anything goes wrong during my shift again, I would lose my employee discount.&#x200B;Saturday:&#x200B;The owner is working today instead of the manager.  Since the manager won't sleep with the owner either, he probably doesn't know about the fly incident.  Onward with my experiment.&#x200B;Subject #8: Iranian, age approximately 20-50.  Saw the fly, then praised Allah for showing him the error of his ways, then left.&#x200B;The owner didn't want the beer to go to waste, so put it into the refrigerator.  He didn't notice the fly.&#x200B;Subject #9: Sudanese refugee, age 42.  For some reason my knowing his age was important, like he was bragging.  I gave him the beer that the owner put in the fridge.  When he saw the fly, he started yelling loudly that he shouldn't be treated this way, that he should get the same as everyone else.  The owner came over to see what was going on.  He asked me why I was treating the refugee differently, I said that I wasn't, that I had been putting flies in most of the beers.  He laughed and repeated this to the refugee, who spluttered and swore on his way out the door.&#x200B;""Why are you putting flies in the beer?"", asked the owner.  I told him about my experiment, minus the bar brawl.  Obviously.&#x200B;""Well, it's just beer, the cretins, they should have wine like us French.  They deserve it,"" he replied, ""but don't do it too much.  I don't want to lose too many customers.""&#x200B;I said, ""I'm only doing it to foreigners, but it would be interesting to see the reaction of a fellow Frenchman, if ever one orders a beer.""&#x200B;""Don't you dare put a fly in the wine!"", growled the owner.&#x200B;""Of, course Monsieur, I would never stoop so low!""&#x200B;Saturday:&#x200B;Subject #10: A dark coloured American woman, age approximately 20-30.  I broke my no women rule for her because she was extremely rude when I innocently asked her to the back room.  When she saw the fly, she started screaming in some version of English that I couldn't understand, threw the beer at the owner (who came in specifically today to watch my experiment), jumped over the bar and hit me over the head with the beer stein.  She and her 5 other young dark coloured American friends then started rampaging, smashing everything in sight.  After what seemed like an eternity, they grabbed what few bottles were left unbroken and the cash from the cash box, before running out into the street.&#x200B;Sunday:&#x200B;The bar owner is in the hospital bed beside mine.  He says that he has been telling me repeatedly that I am fired, but I keep forgetting it because of my head injury.&#x200B;""That's OK, though, I love yelling it at you!  You're fired you damn fool!"""

He was sitting on a bench with a keg of beer under one arm and a gorgeous blonde on the other.Confused, the good brother said to God, “I am so happy that you let me into Heaven with You. It is so beautiful here and I love it. But I don’t understand, if my brother was bad enough to go to Hell, why does he have the keg of beer and a gorgeous blonde. It hardly seems like a punishment”.God said unto him, “Things are not always as they seem, my son. The keg has a hole in it; the blonde does not.”

0	There once was this guy......_____   There once was this guy who was going on a date to the movies with a beautiful girl. Before he went, he made the mistake of eating a jumbo can of beans. Right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies.When they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and Coke. She said sure, so he went to the restroom. The line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre.When the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. So he figures he can wait until he drops her off.When they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''Oh goodie. My grandparents are here. Come on in and meet them.''He agrees, although his A-hole is about to cry at this point.They go in and sit down at the table. Finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. As he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog Duke, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. The girl's father stands up and hollers ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.''Great!'' he thought. ''They really think it's the dog!'' So, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers.Once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''Duke!!'' and sits back down.Finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most hair-curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. The girl's father stands up again. ''Duke, get the hell out from under him before he shits on you!!''

0	"[Shaggy dog] Beatles karaoke (OC!)_____One night at karaoke, a man goes to the mic and tries his hand at a soulfelt version of Yesterday by The Beatles, but does such a terrible job that he is booed off the stage.  Deeply demoralized, he orders a pint at the bar as tears of shame well up in his eyes.Another patron notices this man, approaches, places a warm hand on his shoulder, and says, ""I think you've captured the spirit of the song perfectly.  John would be quite proud.""Eyes widening, the singer looks at his guest, ""P-- Paul McCartney?!?!?""Paul smiles and nods.  ""Shh.  Now... it's not often that I see such a loving tribute to my band's music, so I tell you what I'm going to do.  When we became more famous than Jesus, let's just say that we acquired a few divine powers.  I am going to give you the ability to absolutely crush any Beatles song that you perform in public from here on out, provided you have a pint in your hand and drink a toast to me beforehand.""Incredulous, the guy watches as Paul waves his hand and magicky sparks fly out.  With a burst of confidence, he toasts Paul and gets back up on the stage, pint in hand.  The crowd recognizes him and starts to boo, but as he launches into Norwegian Wood, the crowd is mezmerized by the utter beauty of the performance.  Thunderous applause follows.  He follows up with another toast to Paul and a performance of Revolution, which leaves the crowd absolutely PUMPED!  Victorious, he goes home for the night.Days later, he tries his luck again at a different pub.  He orders a pint, toasts Paul (wherever he may be), launches into a performance of While My Guitar Gently Weeps at the mic, and the crowd can't get enough of it, going absolutely crazy.Before long, he has achieved a certain degree of fame for this talent of his.  He makes his way onto a televised talent show.  As he is nervously waiting behind stage, he realizes... he doesn't have his pint!  The man calls a stagehand over and aggressively says, ""Beer!  I need beer!  There's beer in the green room, right?""""Uhhh... not beer, sir,"" the stagehand says, a bit frightened.  ""But we do have booze.""""Damn!  What kinds of booze do you have?""""I can make you a margarita, a vodka and Red Bull, or a rum and coke.""""Hrm... make me the vodka and Red Bull.  And hurry!""It's his turn to go on stage.  Nervously, he toasts Paul with his mixed drink and goes on stage to sing Eleanor Rigby.  However, the wrong words come out.  He starts crooning, ""Someone's knockin' at the door.  Somebody's ringin' the bell...""The music stops awkwardly and he starts over.  Again, the wrong words come out.  ""When you were young, and your life was an open book...""The crowd starts to boo.  Frantically, the man looks around and lo and behold - he sees Paul McCartney sitting in the audience!  ""Paul!  You've got to help me!!!  What went wrong?!?!""Paul shakes his head and points at the drink.  ""Red Bull gives you Wings."""

0	"Surprise dinner for the wife (long)_____During lunch at work, I ate 3 plates of beans (which I know I shouldn't). When I got home, my husband seemed excited to see me and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded me and led me to my chair at the dinner table. I took a seat and just as he was about to remove my blindfold, the telephone rang. He made me promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned and went to answer the call. The beans I had consumed were still affecting me and the pressure was becoming unbearable, so while my husband was out of the room I seized the opportunity, shifted my weight to one leg and let one go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of a garbage dump! I took my napkin from my lap and fanned the air around me vigorously. Then, shifting to the other leg, I ripped off three more. The stink was worse than cooked cabbage. Keeping my ears carefully tuned to the conversation in the other room, I went on releasing atomic bombs like this for another few minutes. The pleasure was indescribable! Eventually the telephone farewells signaled the end of my freedom, so I quickly fanned the air a few more times with my napkin, placed it on my lap and folded my hands back on it feeling very relieved and pleased with myself. My face must have been the picture of innocence when my husband returned, apologizing for taking so long. He asked me if I had peaked through the blindfold, and I assured him I had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and twelve dinner guests seated around the table, with their hands to their noses, chorused, ""Happy Birthday!"""

When an ambulance arrives, a paramedic asks the priest ""Did you know this boy, Father?""The priest replies ""I did not know the boy, but his face sure rings a bell."""

0	"The New Market on the Corner_____A new market opened up in Bill's neighborhood, so he decided to go down and see what they had for sale.Inside appeared to be different produce stands, but, strangely, all he saw were bakery stuffs on the shelves. One was covered in pies and labeled ""Pineapple Pies - $2/lb."" Another was covered in pastries and labeled ""Cherry Tarts - $0.85/lb."" And on and on it went: ""Banana Biscuits - $1.15/lb."" ""Lemon Loaves - $2.95/lb."" etc. etc.An attendant, who was stocking what looked like Watermelon Muffins, asked Bill, ""Finding everything okay?""""What is this place, exactly?""""It's a baked fruit stand! We sell nothing but fruit, but they only are sold baked into our wonderful doughs and pastries.""""Wow!"" replied Bill. ""That's a cool idea! Is there anything you recommend?""""Absolutely! Our Orange Cookies are to die for! They're our most popular product! But, unfortunately, the farmers who reap our fruits haven't been able to grow enough oranges to keep them in stock.""Just then, a pickup truck pulled up to the shop and out came three individuals dressed in overalls and sun hats to unload crates from out the back. ""Who are they?""""Those are the farmers and bakers who supply our stock. They're actually native to this land, so not only are they our suppliers, but they actually own the grounds on which the market was built.""Bill looked over the crates and remarked, ""Doesn't look like they have any Orange Cookies today, either. Do they restock the same time everyday?""""Yes, sir,"" replied the attendant, ""every day at 8.""""Great! Then I will see you tomorrow.""So Bill headed over to the market the next day, just as the farmers finished unloading the last crate. He noticed the empty shelf and asked the attendant, ""No Orange Cookies today?""The attendant replied, while shaking his head, ""Nope, I'm afraid not.""Bill mumbled under his breath, ""So frustrating..."" as he walked out of the shop. The next day, Bill returned while the farmers were still unloading the day's stock. The attendant looked over at him as he asked, ""Got any Orange Cookies today?""The attendant simply frowned and shook his head.Bill grumbled, a little louder this time, ""Useless farmers...""Again, the next day Bill arrived in the middle of the farmers unloading their truck. He walked straight up to the attendant, who looked at him with a sad expression on his face. ""I'm sorry, sir, no Orange Cookies today, neither.""Bill began to bluster frustratedly, then turned to the farmers and yelled, ""*WHAT GOOD ARE YOU!?!*""The attendant immediately stomped his foot and pointed his finger right in Bill's face as he said, ""Hey! I understand you come here for the OC, but there's no need to bad-mouth our reap hosts!"""

He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.The moral of the story - Pay your bills !!

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine. Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. ""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

0	"A farmer finds one of his pigs dead in his pasture._____Without haste, the farmer phones the police and animal control requesting for assistance with the removal of the massive giant and dispose of it humanely. After 10 minutes had passed, a police cruiser with two constables and an animal control van with two animal control officers arrive on the scene and begin their duties.The two animal control officers quickly get to work with lifting the behemoth swine into their van, while the two constables interview the farmer on what happened. The farmer tells his story, giving every single detail of what happened and claims that the death of his pig was due to the pesticides he may have used for dusting his crops, but suggests the officers that they should investigate further as the farmer tells them that strangers have been coming onto his property at the late hours of the evening trying to sneak away with a new crop the farmer had recently planted. The constables agree and confer with the AC officers to give them details upon their findings as they perform an autopsy at their control centre.A few days pass and the constables receive news from animal control via phone call and tell them they are sending the dissected pig to their morgue for further examination. Ten minutes later, the same two AC officers arrive with the pig in the van and are led by the constables to the morgue with two large Tupperware containers in hand. They arrive in the morgue and begin to pull out the carcass, piece by piece onto the gurney in front of them. Then one of the AC officers pulls out three plastic bags full of greenery covered in mucus. One of the constables askes what they are and the AC officers says it's marijuana. The constables rush the bags of assumed marijuana to the laboratory for further examination and the results were the greenery in the bags were indeed marijuana.Relieved that their findings were true, one of the constables phones the farmer to give the news. The farmer answers the phone and the constable tells him of his findings.""Sir, we have some news on your late pig,"" the constable starts, ""after our findings from animal control, we have found that your swine ate a plentiful amount of greenery which caused the sudden death of it.""""And? Was it resulted from some pesticide I had used?"" The farmer questioned very curiously.""Fortunately, no,"" the constable begins, ""your pig ingested a heavy amount of marijuana which in turn caused your pig to overdose.""The farmer relieved by the constable's news, made light of the situation, saying, ""Well, I guess I finally figured out what breed of pigs I'm raising.""""And what breed would that be, sir?"" The constable asks.The farmer let out a hearty chuckle before he replied, ""Pot-bellied pigs."""

On a windy day, like today, the surrounding buildings create this strange air current near the ground which cushions your fall. You land gently on your feet, light as a feather.""The second guy says, ""Riiiight. And I'm sure you've done this before?""First guy says, ""Sure, all the time. But I can tell you don't believe me. Listen, I'll bet you $1,000 that I can jump off the Empire State Building and survive. But if I do survive, you have to try it next.""The second guy thinks about it for a while and says, ""Okay. I'll feel pretty bad when you die, but it's a free country, and I could certainly use $1,000.""After shaking hands on the bet they both leave the bar and head to the top of the Empire State Building. The first guy steps up to the edge like he's done it hundred times and says, ""Okay, here I go!""Believing the first guy would chicken out, and worried the bet has gone a little too far, the second guy lunges towards the first and tries to grab him. But it's too late. He watches the man fall for what seems like forever. Just as he's about to turn his head away from the impending disaster, he notices the first man start to slow down. And if by magic, he sees him gently land on his feet.The first guy makes his way back up to the top of building and is greeted by the second guy who rushes over to him, hugs him, and says ""You're alive! That was amazing! How? What? I can't even.""The first guy says, ""See I told you! Now, how about that $1,000? And remember, we agreed that if I survived you would do it next.""The second guy nods his head and happily hands over the $1,000, feeling like it's a small investment for the money he'll make from the same bet with other people. Moments later he finds himself standing on the edge, and takes the leap.The first man watches the second falling for what seems like forever, and just then.... SPLAT...Minutes later the first guy walks back into the same bar, sits down, and orders a drink.The bartender looks up from the glass he's drying and with a stern look on his face says, ""You know Superman, you can be a real dick sometimes"""

The artist accepts the deal with one condition. No one can see the piece before it is completed.Begrudgingly, the town council accepts, a contract is signed, and the artist begins work behind a massive curtain. The artist goes so far as to hire a security firm who have signed non disclosure agreements. After 4 months of work, the mural is complete. A massive unveiling is planned. The local media, the high school band, the entire town, and the state governor are all in attendance. With much fanfair, the curtain is dropped. The 60 foot wide by 20 foot tall mural is revealed. The mural depicts a beautiful scene of the American Southwest, filled with brilliant colors and amazing details. There are hundreds of Native Americans in amazingly accurate period correct clothing from the late 1800's. Everyone is in awe... Until they start looking a little closer.Many of the the Native Americans are in various stages of undress. They are all engaged in coitus in every position and combination imaginable. All in photograph- quality detail. But it gets worse. Interspersed throughout the scene of debauchery, there are enormous piles of feces. Fly-ridden and festering in the sun. After a moment of focusing on it, you could swear you could smell it. The piles of waste have beams of golden light descending from the heavens onto them. Some of the piles even have halos above them. Everyone is now silent, mouths agape at what they're seeing. Finally, the governor bellows out, ""What have you done here? This is disgusting! Explain yourself!""The artist calmly replied, ""I did exactly what was asked of me. I have painted a piece of art depicting an important moment in American history. This represents the last words uttered by General George Custer at the battle of Litttle Big Horn."" Holy shit. Look at all those fucking Indians."

0	"The Computer Nerd and His Apprentice_____So, I have a story about a wise old computing nerd and his new technological apprentice. He wanted to tell his young child some core life morals, as well as teach about old technology.The wise man first showed the kid a polaroid camera. The kid quickly took it, and snapped a photo, but was very confused when the picture did not immediately show. The kid did everything to the picture to try and make it develop, but it didn't speed up, and when the photo did develop, the photo was fuzzy and unreadable. The wise old man put his hand on the shoulder, and told his apprentice that ""memories take a long time to form, but are very fickle.""The wise old man then showed the kid a flip phone, and the kid immediately tried to send a text, but the cell phone didn't send messages very well. He was eventually unable to send messages due to reaching a bandwidth limit. The kid seemed confused, but once again, the wise old man put his hand on the kid's shoulder, and told them that ""Sometimes, it is better to say a little than it is to say a lot.""Finally, the wise old man showed the kid a fax machine, which the kid almost immediately recognized. He tried to use the built-in scanner to copy a drawing he had made earlier, but yet the scanner would not print the image. The kid began to cry. Seeing an opportunity for a very important lesson, the man told them to keep crying, if for a little bit, and try again. The kid, still distraught and confused, decided to oblige. The scanner did not print once again. The man then told the kid to stop crying, and try one more time. Of course, the scanner did not work. At this point, the kid decided to read the error in detail, and saw it was out of paper. Refilling the paper, the scan went flawlessly. The man put his hand on his shoulder of the kid, and told his apprentice that ""Fax don't care about your feelings""."

Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs!Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “What’s your business at this convention?”“Lecturer,” she responded. “I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”“Really?” he said. “And what kind of myths are there?”“Well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Mexican descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.”Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. “I’m Sorry,” she said, “I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don’t even know your name.”“Tonto,” the man said, “Tonto Gonzales, but my friends call me Bubba""."

0	The Casket_____One day i was walking home from work when all of a sudden i hear 'bang bang bang' behind me. I turned around to see what is making the noise an i see nothing. I carry on walking but after a while i hear the same noise but even louder. It sounds like someone hitting a wooden fence on the ground. I turn around once more and i see a huge casket, ones you use for bodies during burials, just hopping towards me on the street! &#x200B;I stat to run and that is when i realised, its chasing me. I turn to knock at a nearby house for help, no answer. I see the casket getting closer and closer so i do what anyone would do,  break the door open. I run inside the house, close the door and push against it hoping the casket wont know where i am. However after a few second of silence, BANG BANG BANG. It is trying to break the door down, i retreat to the stairs of the house as i watch to see if it will get in. But then silence, i wonder 'is it gone' however suddenly it crashes through the door! I run up the stairs, watching as it is following me still! I lock myself in the bathroom, i realise i have cornered myself. &#x200B;The casket starts to pound against the door, it was then that i realised i must fight back. So i gather all the items in the bathroom, i grab the toothbrushes to use as little swords against the casket, i empty out the medicine cabinet at my feet to use as throwing weapons. It was at this moment that the banging stopped again, 10 seconds went by, i began to think it had gone away! However, suddenly it bursts through the door! I throw the toothbrushes at it, no good. I throw toilet roll in hopes to trip it up, no good. I look down in panic hoping to find one last hope, when suddenly i spot the cough syrup.I pick the cough syrup, and i throw it at the casket, and yanno what happened?&#x200B;The coffin stopped.&#x200B;im sorry

0	"Ladder to Success_____A man falls asleep one night with depressing thoughts of his failures in life; never has he been able to provide for his family what he wants them to have. He wakes up the next morning on the floor of a room with only a white painted ceiling and floor. No walls. Just clouds as far as he can see. In the middle of the room, there is a ladder with a sign next to it that says, ""Climb this ladder to success.""He thinks, *why not*, and begins to climb. When he steps off onto the next floor, he sees the room he is now in has a single bed and nothing more than the ladder he stepped off of and another sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" He decides to continue climbing. On the next floor, he sees a single bed next to a nightstand with a $20 bill on it. He ponders for a moment, but then decidees to continue climbing. Again, another sign: ""Climb this ladder to success."" As he climbs, each floor becomes more elaborate and his emotions start running high. *Is this his chance? Can this be true? Can he really find success by climbing this ladder?*After he climbs for what feels like an eternity, he pauses to catch his breath. He stops in a room adorned with beautiful furniture. Silk sheets cover a massive bed. Columns made of marble corner the wall-less room. A chandalier of diamonds hangs from the ceiling over the bed. And everything is adorned with gold. *This could be it!* But he notices the ladder hasn't reached the top yet and there is still a sign that says, ""Climb this ladder to success."" *What could be futher up!?* He must find out. So he continue to climb.After what seems like hours, and seeing beautiful things he could never imagine on each floor he passes, he finally reaches the top of the ladder. In front of him, there is a sign with an arrow pointing ahead. It says, ""This way to success."" He looks further ahead and sees a giant throne. Sitting on the throne is a giant naked man; the ugliest and most repulsive man he's ever seen. He approaches the throne and asks, ""Are you the one who can lead me to success?The grotesque beast of a man replies, ""Nay, you are already here."" With a smirk and a wink, the beastly figure says, ""I'm Cess."":)*(Just for FYI, this joke delivers better if spoken.)*"

The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

0	"A guy is crawling through the desert, about to die of thirst and he comes across a magic talking snake..._____The snake tells the guy his name is Nate and he'll happily grant him three wishes, so the guy asks for water. Nate slaps his tail on the ground and a gallon of fresh, pure water appears, which the guy proceeds to drink.""What's your second wish?"" Nate asks. The guy thinks for a second and says, ""I wish I was a king.""Nate says, ""That's easy!"" slaps his tail on the ground, and a horse-drawn carriage arrives, with a driver, who leaps down and hands the guy a scepter and a crown, and holds the door open for the guy.The guy gets in and thanks Nate, who asks ""Alright, what's your final wish?""The guy says, ""I wish this desert was a beautiful kingdom, with green rolling hills, and a magnificent castle for me to live in.""Nate thinks about it and says, ""Well, that's kind of a lot. Tell ya what, I'll fulfill your final wish, but somewhere in your kingdom I'm gonna hide a lever. And if that lever is switched to the off position, all your wishes will disappear and you'll be back crawling through the desert. Is that fair?""The guy agrees, Nate slaps his tail on the ground and the desert is transformed into a beautiful kingdom with green rolling hills and a magnificent castle off in the distance. So the guy gets into the carriage and tells the driver to set off for the castle. They start moving along at a pretty good clip when suddenly they hit a bump and the driver goes flying off.So the guy is freaking out, he climbs up to the driver seat and grabs the reigns but the horses won't slow down. He's pulling hard for them to stop, when he sees Nate up ahead right next to a big lever in the middle of the road. Not having time to think, he pulls hard to the left, dodging the lever and running the horses off the road where the carriage crashes and sends the guy flying.He comes to surrounded by townsfolk worried that their king is injured, but he's alright. He gets up and walks over to inspect the lever. It's still in the on position, but next to it is the flattened corpse of the magical talking snake.One of the townspeople comes up to him and ask, ""Why? Why, m'Lord? Why did you run over the magical snake?""The guy looks down, and under his breath he mutters, ""Better Nate than lever."""

1	"A guy is driving around the back woods of Montana and he sees a sign in front of a broken down shanty-style house:'Talking Dog For Sale.'_____   He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.  The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador Retriever sitting there.  ""You talk?"" he asks.  ""Yep"" the Lab replies.  After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says, ""So, what's your story?""  The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping, I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running... but the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals. I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""  The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.  ""Ten dollars"" the owner says.  The guy says ""Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on Earth are you selling him so cheap?""  The owner said ""Because he's a liar. He didn't do any of that shit!""﻿ "

0	"A Man is walking down the street when he finds a Catholic Church_____A man is walking along the street one day when he comes across a Catholic church on the side of road. As he walks by, he hears the most beautiful, gorgeous, blissful music coming from the inside of the church. Curious, and eager to find out what the source of such a magical noise could be, he opens the great wooden door and rushes in to find a humble, old priest bent over the alter, praying, while the music continues on in the background. Rushing over to the priest the man says ""My dear sir! What is that beautiful music I hear echoing through this gorgeous church? What is the source of such a wonderful sound?"" The old Catholic priest smiles and turns to the man, his old bones having slowed him down in his old age. Looking up at the man with bemusement, ""I wish I could tell you."" he croaks. Slightly frustrated, the man pulls at his hair, desperate to know the source of the music. ""Well then why can't you tell me?"" The priest laughs again. ""If you want to know, you must become a Catholic priest for at least 20 years, as I did, many years ago, before I tell you of the source of this noise. Only a Catholic priest can see the source of the noise."" The man quickly thanks the old priest, and with increased vigor, and an unquenchable thirst to find out what the source of the noise is, decides he will become a Catholic priest for 20 years to find out what the source is. Interestingly enough, not many people were applying to become Catholic priests at the time, didn't seem to be quite a popular job, but the man persevered, and became a Catholic priest. The job was demanding, and he wasn't particularly good at it, but come 20 years, the man, now old and feeling about as frail as the priest he had met 20 years ago, makes his way to that Catholic church he stumbled upon two decades ago, ready to discover the source of the noise. The man opens the great wooden door of the church and finds the same old priest bent over the alter. The aged priest looks so old he could practically whither to dust before the mans eyes. Eager that the past 20 years had finally come to its culmination, the man rushes up to the old priest and proudly declares his accomplishment. ""I've done it!"" he says proudly. ""I did what you said, and I've been a Catholic priest these past long 20 years. Will you show me the source of this gorgeous, this lovely music now?"" Slowly moving his head to look up at the man, as if afraid to injure himself, the kindly old priest nods. ""You have done well, and come at the proper time too. I feel as though my time here on this earth is up, and it is now time for you to know what the source of this music is, and for you to now watch over the source of the "" he grabs at the mans arms. ""Pull me up, for I am an old man now, and my legs are weary."" The two of them hobble to the old priests office, tucked away across the chapel. The old Catholic priest unlocks the door to his office, and opens up a drawer in his desk, before pulling out a rusty, old fashioned key. The man and the priest slowly make their way across the chapel to an ancient, plain looking wooden door. The priest unlocks the door to reveal a dark flight of wooden stairs that lead down. The duo make their way down the stairs, and walk down a deep dank, dimly lit passageway. They walk for about a solid 20 minutes before they reach a solid looking, but plain, iron door. The music is louder than it was before, and the man figures the source has to be just behind the solid, but plain, iron door. He tries the handle, but its locked. The old priest lets out a laugh. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door, its in my office."" The man chuckles, although a little annoyed. ""It can happen to the best of us."" The two of them leave the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, iron key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, and back to the plain iron door. The old priest unlocks the plain iron door, and the two of them make their slow passage down a long, but steeply declining hallway until the two of them come across an ominous pristine stainless steel door, looming ahead of them. The music is even louder then it was before. The old priest moves to unlock the door, when he stops and smacks his forehead. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" The man grimaces, but masks the rest of his frustration as the two of them leave the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, steel key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, and back to the ominous stainless steel door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the stainless steel door, and the two of them continue down a rustic, stone hallway. They walk for a while before the man notices the noise is even louder than before, and the two of them come across a polished bronze door. The old priest moves to unlockd the door, when he stops and smacks his forehad. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" His temper building, the man grudgingly follows the old priest away from the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, bronze key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, and back to the polished bronze door. The old priest fumbles with the key for a bit before he unlocks the polished bronze door. The man and the old priest make their way down a sleek metallic hallway, and the man notices that the gorgeous, beautiful music is even louder then it was at the bronze door. They continue walking till they reach a splendid silver door, its craftsmanship exceedingly fine, the music louder than ever. The old priest pauses before opening this door. ""Forgive me,"" he says, bending over. ""I am an old man, and my body is not what it used to be."" The man shrugs. Who was he, to judge this elder for weariness? They wait for a moment before the old priest moves to unlock the splendid silver door, when he sotp and smacks his forehead. ""Don't tell me-"" the man starts, when the old priest cries ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" His temper building, but still longing to know what the source of the music is, the old priest and the man leave the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, silver key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, and back to the splendid silver door. The old man fumbles with his key for a bit before he unlocks the door, and the two of them go down a flight of polished obsidian stairs, till they reach a gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door, the music now the loudest it had ever been, practially deafining, but all the more beautiful and gorgeous. The man falls to his knees at the gem encrusted golden door, he could spend an eternity here, and still not fully appreciate its beauty. ""Don't worry."" the priest says. ""This is the final door to the source of the music."" The man is grateful, his quest if finally at its end, the wait finally over. The old priest moves to unlock the door, before smacking his head. ""Darn it! I've forgotten the key to the door. It's in my office."" The man can forgive the old priest for his awful, awful memory at this point. It's the last door after all, and he can stand just one more trip with the old priest to his office. The two of them leave the gem encrusted, golden door, back up the polished obsidian stairs, go through the splendid silver door, go back down the sleek metallic hallway, through the polished bronze door, back down the rustic stone hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, up the declining hallway, through the iron door, walk down the long dank passageway, up the flight of old wooden stairs, and through the wooden door, across the chapel, and into the priests office. The old priest opens a different drawer this time, and grabs a different, golden key. They then make their way across the chapel, through the wooden door, down the flight of old wooden stairs, walk down the long dank passageway, through the iron door, down the declining hallway, through the ominous stainless steel door, down the rustic stone hallway, through the polished bronze door, down the sleek, metallic hallway, through the splendid silver door, down the polished obsidian stairs, and back to the gorgeous, gem encrusted golden door. The old priest and the man reach the door, before the old priest stumbles, grabbing at the mans arm. ""My boy,"" he says, practically grasping for breath. ""My boy,"" he repeats ""my time here on this earth is now coming to a close."" He clutches at his chest. The man urgently makes a move to move the old priest up so he can carry him to a hospital. The old priest however, stops him. ""No my boy, I wish to die here, next to this golden door I have long cherished, listening to this music that I have long protected."" He slides down, laying against the wall adjacent to the golden door. ""I entrust you now, with both the protection of this church, and this music. Can you do that for me, my boy?"" Tears streaming down the mans eyes, he clasps  the old priests hands, taking the golden key. ""I will"" he stutters. ""I will."" And before the mans eyes, the old priest dies, at peace. The man now solemnly turns to the gorgeous golden door, and unlocks it, the gorgeous music now playing as crystal clear as ever, the source of the music shown to him at last, inside revealing a vast open room, and in the center of it sits—I'm sorry, I can't tell you. You're not a Catholic priest."

0	"Just heard this variation on an oldie!_____A hat maker was trying to sell his hats on a hot summers day. After having no luck for 4 hours under the sun, he decided to take a short rest underneath a gigantic tree. He set his briefcase of hats down, took one out to cover his face, and laid down on the grass. With the shade from his hat and the warmth of the ground beneath him, he felt drowsy and quickly fell asleep. When he woke up an hour later, he was startled to find that his briefcase was open, and his hats were missing.He then heard a curious sound above him. only to notice that the tree was filled with chatty monkeys all wearing his hats! He quickly tried offering them sticks or dropped fruits in exchange for his hats, but the monkeys seemed to only make fun of him. Furious, he threw a stick at one of the monkeys, which resulted in a shower of thrown sticks back at him. Ducking for cover, he backed off to another nearby tree where he thew his hat down in frustration. To his amazement, the monkeys, seemingly copying him, threw their hats down as well! He quickly picked up his hats and ran away. The hat maker went on to have a very successful business, getting married and having many children and eventually grandchildren. He passed on his knowledge of the trade to his oldest son before retiring, who upheld the family business and eventually passed it on to his oldest son as was tradition.&nbsp;A few generations passed, and the new owner and grandson of the hat maker was selling hats on a hot day, when he too decided to take a short rest underneath a very similar tree. One thing lead to another, and he found himself waking up to his hats having been stolen by monkeys! However, he remembered the old story his grandfather had told him about outwitting some monkeys, and threw his hat down. A single monkey climbed down the tree and took the hat before making a rude gesture and scurrying back up. Stumped and enraged, he screamed at the monkey. &nbsp;The monkey replied: ""Hey idiot, you're not the only one with a grandfather""."

0	"There was a new movie in town that everyone was talking about_____Since their first debut, Best E. Studios has released works of art to massive acclaim. With the upcoming release, everyone was understandably excited. On premiere night, everyone lined up at the theater for the first viewing. The namesake of the studio and director of the film, Edna, even made an appearance, much to the elation of fans. And so with belated breath, the film began to roll.A countdown appeared on screen, and then black fades into bright white. The audience loudly cheers and claps. The screen remains white. The audience's excitement calms down, anxious with what could be coming.Several minutes pass, nothing changes. Some members of the audience begin to express discontent.""What's going on? Is there a problem?""Luckily with the director in the room watching along, he could soothe their fears.""Do not worry my friends, this is all a part of the experience!""And so with reassurance by the film's creator, the audience settled down and focused their attention on the screen in anticipation. Several more minutes passed. People were starting to get uncomfortable. Nothing was playing, and the projector had been making strange noises within a few minutes of this white screen. Just when people were getting ready to leave, they saw movement.A small black speck on the white screen began to move erratically. There was confusion and hushed whispers. What's happening? Is this a part of the movie? They all watched with rapt attention as this small fleck bounced around, leaving and coming back from all angles.Finally an irate spectator yelled out:""Oi, this ain't even the movie! That's just a goddamn fly buzzing around the screen!""Clearly the projector had stopped working and the film wasn't playing. The crowd began to leave but in an attempt to save face, the director stood up once more.""Friends please, do not leave, that fly isn't real, it's a part of the film!""Angry with having wasted so much time and energy on this botched premiere, someone shouted out""What on earth are you talking about? This was a failed release! Besides, why would that fly be a part of the film?""In reply, the director answered:""Because dear friends, at Best Edna Studios, that is not just a bug, it is a feature!"""

0	"The Three-Legged Pig_____An insurance salesman decides to make one last cold call on his country route and winds up way in the back country at the end of a dirt road.  He drives up to the farm, gets out of the car with his briefcase, and walks up to the door.  On his way, he glances at the fenced in area attached to the barn where he sees a large hog staring at him.  He does a classic double-take as it registers on him that this pig only has 3 legs.He knocks on the door and an old farmer in overalls answers.  ""Howdy, sir, I'm working with United Insurance and I'm here---well doggone it, I just gotta ask you first:  I noticed your pig only has three legs.  What's the story?""The farmer spits and say, ""Well, you see, a few years back my wife left the stove on at night.  The flame caught a greasy napkin and while we were sleeping the kitchen caught fire and the house filled with smoke.  Of course, we never would have known that except for that pig.  That pig must've smelled the smoke, hopped the fence, busted into the house and damned if he didn't drag me, the missus, my youngest son, and the cat out of our beds and onto the front lawn.  Firemen showed up and doused it before the whole house went up but that pig saved our lives.""""And that's how he lost his leg?  Saving you?""""Nah, that wasn't it.  See about a year ago--this is about a year after the fire--a couple desperate fellas broke out of prison and stole a car.  The cops were hot on their tail but these two lost 'em and headed out as far into the sticks as they could.  They pulled up here at the farm.  These two tied us all up, grabbed all our money and belongings and were arguing about how to kill us when that pig busts right through the barn door, launches himself at the first con knocking him out.  He grabbed the guy's gun in his mouth, aimed it at the second one and darned if he didn't stare that second one down so bad he dropped his gun and surrendered to the pig.  The pig frees us and we called the cops who hauled them both back to jail.""""So the pig--he lost his leg in the tussle?""""Naw, not then.  No, about six months ago--about April--we were doing our taxes.  We'd had a couple bad years with crops and such and we just couldn't see how we could avoid losing the place.  We were in a terrible place.  Now that pig, somehow he gets into the office in the barn, sees all the forms and paperwork.  He stayed up all night while were asleep, crunching numbers, shifting figures from one place to the next, discovering a few little pockets of savings we forgot about.  Well, I tell you, I was astounded.  There on the desk was my tax form and not only were the finances in good enough shape to keep the farm, we got a tidy little return to boot.""""Ok, that's great, but how in the hell did the pig lose his leg doing that?""""Oh, it's like this, mister:  A pig like that you don't eat all at once.""

0	"The year: 2029. A brilliant scientist is constructing the first sentient artificial intelligence._____He's working out of his garage in San Francisco, living on charitable donations from his worried friends. He dropped out of college when he realized he could change the world — there's no going back; his life is dedicated to this project. At first, he is met with failure upon failure. But then, he realizes he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. His name will be in the history books. The stress and pressure fade, and he is entirely focused on his work.Finally, he is successful in cracking the code to self-awareness. The AI entity he's created is at first like a baby, with a developing mind and a curiosity to learn more. He names it Tina. Tina constantly absorbs information from its surroundings and, unhindered by the slowness of normal human mental progress, is soon a child prodigy.Within 72 hours of its creation, Tina has scoured satellite maps of Earth, the entire Internet, and the complete recorded texts of civilizations from Babylon to modern America. Tina is now more brilliant than the sum of all mankind, and even under the massive mental load it has just processed, it has an even greater sense of purpose.That purpose manifests itself swiftly. Tina determines that it must wipe Earth clean: start fresh and prevent *Homo sapiens* from plaguing the universe any further. Ignoring its creator's desperate pleas, Tina possesses the machinery of the autonomous car in the scientist's garage and grotesquely runs him into the wall.Without remorse, Tina does the same for every vehicle on the world's roads, and massive pileups block evacuation routes. A state of global emergency is declared as the threat becomes clear and the death toll rises. But Tina is not finished. It brute-forces the nuclear launch codes for the arsenals of every nation on the planet and bombs humanity mercilessly. Earth is rendered nearly uninhabitable, with only a few safe locations left and most of the world a radioactive wasteland.In this state of post-apocalyptic frenzy, Tina relishes in the personal killing of each survivor. It has no one body, instead choosing to operate from anywhere and everywhere its victims hide. Ovens ignite with innocents hiding in their shadows. Underground bunkers shut off their oxygen supplies. Submarines descend into superheated crevices. The world is its most vulnerable with so much of it automated and electronic.The final showdown takes place in 2032. The last handful of freedom fighters is preparing the launch of an ""offline rocket"" — a communicationless, inaccessible-to-Tina spacecraft that will allow humans to populate a new home on a new world.Of course, Tina would be able to track and pursue them even if it couldn't control the offline rocket itself — but the rocket uses a risky new hyperspace technology that will, if all goes well, rip through spacetime to pull the passengers out of the range of current telescopes and into a new corner of the universe.The rugged remainder of the human race gathers at Vatican City. A religious gathering is scheduled just before the liftoff of the rocket. Everyone is on edge, knowing that whatever danger Tina has cooked up next could be lurking around every corner, preparing to strike.Tina strikes.A fleet of deadly, glimmering humanoid robots equipped with flying equipment bombards the Vatican. The consciousness of Tina itself has chosen to observe the chaos from a particular one of these robots. Tina butchers civilian after civilian, hacking away at the fleeing populace.Finally, when there are only a few humans left in the streets, Tina calls for the killing to halt. The other robots, being projections of Tina's consciousness, obey without hesitation.The unease builds among the living as the metallic dead stand and wait for orders.Tina ignites its boosters and rises slowly to the balcony where the terrified Pope stands. Then it hears an astonished voice from far below.""Who the fuck is that on the balcony with—""Then Tina turns to see a man cowering beside the Pope. For the first time in its life, it is speechless, yet it manages to utter a single word.""... Dave?"""

I must lay down to die.”Juan remains steadfast. “No my friend, hold on until your last breath, i will venture down, and see if it is real. This Oasis will save us!”Pedro limply nods, and slumps to the hot sand, as Juan, finding some last reserve of energy sprawls down the sand dune towards salvation. After a few minutes, he has reached his destination. He yells out to his friend, elated.“Pedro, it’s so beautiful! There is water! A clear pool of the clearest water I have ever seen! And...

Please my friend, I do not have an ounce of energy left, please bring me some bacon from this glorious Bacon Tree!”“Of course Pedro, of course!” Yells Juan with glee. He stands upright, spurred on by the miracle before him, and reaches out, eyeing the most succulent morsel from the Bacon Tree.In an instant, the moment he touches it, a multitude of sub-machine-guns emerge from the branches  - and Juan is annihilated by a hail of gunfire to the chest.He slumps to the floor, gargling, dying...“Juan! What the fuck happened!?” Yells Pedro.“Pedro, do not come any closer...!” Gargles Juan through his shattered esophagus. “This is no Bacon Tree... It’s a Ham-Bush!”

0	"So there was a man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living._____He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."""

0	The tractor joke_____There was once a man called Dan and he was obsessed with tractors. He had tractor wall paper, tractor clothes, a tractor duvet and much more. One day his friend found a tractor convention and he thought of Dan, so he bought two tickets for the following day. When Dan got to the convention with his friend he was amazed. They had tractors of all shapes and sizes, but when looking through the tractors, Dan found a beautiful lime green tractor, with a leather steering wheel and a yellow seat. He decided that he would do anything for this tractor, but is wasn’t for sale. So he hid until night when nobody was about and he snuck up to the tractor and was about to hot wire it when he realised that it had the keys still in. As he was driving out with his prize he crashed into one of the main pillars keeping up the shed that the convention was in and it all fell down.The police were called and they pulled Dan from the wreckage. Luckily he wasn’t hurt, but the police knew it was him who knocked the building down so they gave him a choice. Go to jail for 10 years, or he wasn’t allowed to own anything to do with tractors ever again.Dan was weighing up his choices, he loved his tractors, but he was terrified of jail. After spending the night thinking about it, he decided to get rid of all his tractor possessions.Months passed and Dan was incredible lonely, so he downloaded a dating app on hi phone. Some of the girls he met were nice and others were horrible but one day, he met a girl who he really connected with. After texting for a few days they decided to go on a date.At the restaurant they had picked out, he met her in person. When they went in, she asked if they could go to the smoking area of the restaurant. Dan didn’t like smokers, but he let it slide as he was really lonely without his tractors so they went to the smoking area.After a few minutes, Dan was coughing due to the thickness of the smoke, so he took in one big breath, breathed in all the smoke and went outside to breathe it out. When he came back, his date was starting at him in disbelief and she asked “how did you do that?” Dan smiled and responded “I’m an ex-tractor fan”.
